unit_description_historical_texts_text_hv_unit_ytr_gallants_of_the_people	Whilst all Yellow Turban warriors are happy to wade into the heart of battle, the Gallants of the People were made to hold the frontline against enemies - to be anywhere else would be to waste their talent and ardour. \\n\\n They are heavily-armoured, though not as heavily plated as some other warriors, yet with great axe they are able to push back the advancing foe whilst deflecting blows. Where their mail may falter, their fanaticism never will.	false
unit_description_short_texts_text_hv_unit_ytr_gallants_of_the_people	Bravery drives a warrior to battle more effectively than any general; a great axe keeps them there.	false
unit_description_historical_texts_text_hv_unit_ytr_bringers_of_righteousness	These concerned citizens call themselves the Bringers of Righteousness and have used their wealth to purchase their own armour and weapons. Each has undertaken extensive training to become proficient using polearms and learned how to use a bow through traditional archery competitions. \\n\\n Though they wear expensive tunics, their commitment is not mere vainglory; their not-inconsiderable skill with the bow and polearm make them extremely useful due to their flexibility, and therefore welcomed to join the fight for the Great Peace.	false

unit_description_historical_texts_text_hv_unit_ytr_reclaimers	The role of these troops can be deduced from their appearance; their armour pieces are mismatched, put together by collecting those left in the aftermath of battle, or sourced from nearby villages. \\n\\n Their most important function is to search and collect loot, weapons and armour after the battle to put towards the Great Peace. They are not good at close combat, so they use a bunch of captured repeating crossbows to support frontline.	false
unit_description_short_texts_text_hv_unit_ytr_reclaimers	This infantry gathers equipment dropped or left behind in battle to help their brothers and sisters continue the fight.	false
unit_description_historical_texts_text_hv_unit_ytr_righteous_vanguards	To be the bolt of justice, to spearhead a charge deep into the enemy lines, delivering vengeance for an oppressed people, this is the task of these warriors. \\n\\n These cavalry are one of the few shock cavalry of the Yellow Turbans army.; once they have ploughed into an enemy formation with their spears, they have the armour and the skill to keep fighting, thrusting with enough force to pierce most armour with righteous intensity.	false

unit_description_historical_texts_text_hv_unit_ytr_the_lands_chosen	It is a central tenet of Taoism that the land must be revered and nurtured; it, in turn, will return to us its bounties. Those chosen warriors who receive of nature's boons must use its gifts to pursue those who have contributed to the corruption and destruction plaguing the land. \\n\\n From the boughs of the trees, arrows and crossbows are fashioned and handled by warriors who wield them with greater expertise than most of their contemporaries.	false
unit_description_short_texts_text_hv_unit_ytr_the_lands_chosen	Nature must be preserved and the world saved. These warriors will see it done.	false
unit_description_historical_texts_text_hv_unit_ytr_virtuous_noblemen	The Yellow Turban rebellion challenges the corruption that poisons China and has made many question old loyalties. \\n\\n These noblemen have renounced their former warlords to seek justice and redemption. Their previous life of privilege has trained and equipped them well, and they ride into battle clad in ornate armour and helmets upon impressive mounts of the finest stock. \\n\\n With sharp spears, the impact of their charge is merely a way to break the enemy’s lines for deadly close combat.	false
