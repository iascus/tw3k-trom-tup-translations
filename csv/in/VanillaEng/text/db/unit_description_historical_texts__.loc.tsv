unit_description_historical_texts_text_3k_main_unit_metal_hidden_axes	A group of screaming enemy soldiers charging towards you is unnerving, but when those soldiers are holding axes, it becomes terrifying. Though the heavy fu axe was once used as a tool, it has been repurposed for the battlefield - now its chief purpose is to split foes' skulls. \\n\\n These warriors are considered shock-troops because of their powerful charge, which staggers enemies and leaves them vulnerable; the ferocious swing of their dual axes carve through their enemies in short time.	false
unit_description_historical_texts_text_3k_dlc04_unit_fire_tyrant_slayers	It is beyond question to the Yellow Turbans that the time of the Azure Sky is over; the land is plagued with pain - a pain drawn from a misbegotten dynasty that must be unseated. The Han have descended into corruption and tyranny, and there is no choice now but to see them put to the sword. \\n\\n Those tasked with ending such cruelty draw their halberds before them, riding down those against them with an ardent obligation that will drive their lances straight through the disreputable, hollow-hearted Han.	false
unit_description_historical_texts_text_3k_dlc07_unit_metal_northern_sabre_infantry	Although the Han's northern army was never a large force, it was a professional one. Every warrior within it was worth several of his locally-rallied counterparts. Such is necessary, when the charge is to defend against mysterious menaces beyond the border. \\n\\n With sabres and shields in hand, these troops are made for the cut-and-thrust of melee, where they will remain until victory finds them, or death claims them.	false
unit_description_historical_texts_text_3k_dlc07_unit_earth_northern_sabre_cavalry_captain	Courage, order, and authority are the foundation upon which a good captain commands his men. Amidst the intensity of battle and the thundering of hooves, their elite training allows these riders to maintain discipline as they charge at enemy lines. With sabres drawn, they attack in formation, striking fear into the hearts of their opponents before expertly engaging them in melee. \\n\\n Under the leadership of a truly skilled officer, these cavalrymen are fit to ride at the head of armies, and lead garrisons in the stalwart defence of their homes.	false
unit_description_historical_texts_text_3k_dlc07_unit_water_northern_mounted_raiders	From horseback, a warrior can survey the world, bloodied and torn as it is. A warrior can also move faster, strike harder, and retreat quicker when in the saddle than on foot. When combined with the skill and equipment of an archer, mounted troops become one of a warlord's greatest assets. \\n\\n A unit of mounted archers can harass an enemy, inflicting causalities, and retreat before a counter-attack can be mustered. To the savvy general, they are invaluable.	false
unit_description_historical_texts_text_3k_dlc05_unit_wood_tiger_guard	For the warlord who thrives in the heat of battle, at the head of the charge, only the most elite soldiers can be chosen to fight alongside him. To the bitter end, these warriors will fight for their lord, and then beyond. \\n\\n Not even the death of their lord can stay their fury; if anything, these warriors will fight ever-more fanatically to avenge a fallen master than when he lived.	false
unit_description_historical_texts_text_3k_dlc04_unit_fire_destroyer_of_traitors	Insurrection is rising across the land; a dark and insidious sort of treason. For those who still believe in the Han, it cannot be allowed to continue. \\n\\n These armoured troops are equipped with spears for when battle comes, ready to deliver devastating charges into the foe until such a time as their energies are spent or their enemies wiped out.	false
unit_description_historical_texts_text_3k_main_unit_water_repeating_crossbowmen	The slow loading of a crossbow – its drawback over the bow - is eliminated by the addition of a magazine. Attributed to Zhuge Liang, the magazine is loaded with several bolts, then quickly released and loaded with a one-handed lever. \\n\\n The firing speed decreases the power of the bolts, and makes them less likely to penetrate enemies’ armour, but because the user does not need to hold the string drawn until they wish to fire, the crossbowman can use both hands to steady his aim if needed.	false
unit_description_historical_texts_text_3k_dlc04_unit_metal_huanglao_s_paragons	Before Taoism was established, before it was codified into the fundamentals of the movement, there was Huanglao, the way of the Old Master. These warriors fight with the belief that the emperor is the first among equals and not beyond question or intervention.\\n\\n Excellent on the offence and also good at defending, the paragons may be a small unit but they pack a punch once they are able to insert themselves completely into the furore of battle.	false
unit_description_historical_texts_text_3k_main_unit_wood_ji_militia	The thunderous pounding of hooves, the blackening of the air as dirt is flung from galloping legs, and the impending impact of a horse in full charge can be an almost apocalyptic vision of terror for a humble foot soldier. \\n\\n These militia troops are therefore armed with ji polearms, which are ‘dagger-axes’ with an angled blade attached to the top and a spear added to the tip. These versatile weapons extend the user’s reach and enable the wielder to slash and pierce riders, or dismount them by hooking their neck and pulling.	false
unit_description_historical_texts_text_3k_main_unit_metal_jian_infantry_captain	The jian is a straight, double-edged sword known as the 'Gentleman of Weapons', and considered to be one of the four major weapons alongside the gun, dao and qiang. It takes a year of training before one is considered competent enough to use it, and so only the most skilled swordsmen are equipped with it. \\n\\n The role of the Jian Sword Guard is to hold the line against enemy attacks, and their swordsmanship, leather armour and gourd shields enable them to do this long after others have fallen to exhaustion.	false
unit_description_historical_texts_text_3k_main_unit_metal_pearl_dragons	It is easier to pin the wind than to hit a member of the Pearl Dragons! Their light tunics allow these agile warriors to move quickly to easily dodge enemy blows, their gou lian dao polearms deflecting incoming projectiles so that they bounce off and clatter harmlessly to the ground. \\n\\n The gou lian dao is a polearm with a curved blade and a smaller, sharpened hook. An offensive as well as defensive weapon, it is especially fearsome in charges against engaged opponents.	false
unit_description_historical_texts_text_3k_ytr_unit_metal_venerable_wu	The Venerable Wu follow the ancient shamanistic tradition, entering battle adorned in charms, amulets and medicine. These trinkets are rumoured to grant them greater resistance to death and injury and adds to their supernatural reputation. \\n\\n Many have heard whispers of the Wu’s powers to call down curses upon their enemies, as well as contact or even raise the dead, and to hear their muttered incantations is to know dread. It is this fear that makes them so valuable on the field to break the morale of superstitious enemies.	false
unit_description_historical_texts_text_3k_main_unit_metal_warriors_of_the_left	These troops have mastered the jian; a double-edged sword that takes a year of training to even become competent. This singles them out for selection for the Warriors of the Left, the best soldiers from an already elite group. \\n\\n They have been equipped with heavy armour to protect them in their role to stand fast and hold the line, as they wait for enemy soldiers who are brave – or foolish enough – to risk the wrath of their expert swordsmanship.	false
unit_description_historical_texts_text_3k_ytr_unit_metal_chanters	There are many ways to contribute to the Great Peace; these chanters are not warriors – though they carry basic maces should the need arise – but are vital to give encouragement to their brothers and sisters. \\n\\n Their yellow robes are draped with many charms, and they sing Taoist chants to embolden the hearts of those nearby. Without the burden of armour, they can move quickly to inspire wavering units struck by doubts and remind them for what they fight.	false
unit_description_historical_texts_text_3k_dlc04_unit_wood_gallants_of_the_people	Whilst all Yellow Turban warriors are happy to wade into the heart of battle, the Gallants of the People were made to hold the frontline against enemies - to be anywhere else would be to waste their talent and ardour. \\n\\n They are heavily-armoured, though not as heavily plated as some other warriors, yet with spear and shield they are able to push back the advancing foe whilst deflecting blows. Where their mail may falter, their fanaticism never will.	false
unit_description_historical_texts_text_3k_main_unit_wood_warriors_of_ye	To guard against a cavalry charge, use the horse’s momentum and weight against them; brace long polearms at an angle and await the charge so the horses pierce themselves on the waiting defences. \\n\\n A ji polearm has an angled blade attached to the top and a spear added to the tip, making it a versatile weapon for hooking and dismounting cavalry or slashing at riders. \\n\\n While these troops brace themselves against cavalry charges, their own hides are protected by iron armour.	false
unit_description_historical_texts_text_3k_main_unit_water_trebuchet	When besieging an enemy settlement, the first and greatest obstacle to overcome are its defences. Trebuchets launch heavy projectiles over long distances to batter down walls and barriers. \\n\\n A heavy counterweight is raised to lower a beam, and the projectiles are loaded onto the beam’s sling. \\n\\n A switch drops the counterweight, launching the projectiles; the impact is devastating but inaccurate, so trebuchets are best used against immobile targets such as walls rather than moving enemy troops.	false
unit_description_historical_texts_text_ep_unit_xu_raiders	The speed and mobility of raiders is their greatest strength. Less armed and armoured than their contemporaries, raiders are nevertheless invaluable in softening up less defensible enemies and crushing those who try to flee. \\n\\n Under Sima Yue's leadership, raiders bear down upon enemies with axes drawn, cleaving through any foe foolish - or insignificant - enough to not be well protected, as easily as a hand may pass through water.	false
unit_description_historical_texts_text_3k_main_unit_fire_qiang_marauders	Many fear the nomadic tribespeople of the north, and with good reason; their experience of horses makes them excellent cavalry troops, and their history of raiding speaks to the swift brutality of their attacks. \\n\\n They are best used in offensive actions against exposed enemy flanks. \\n\\n Though only armoured with light leather, their qiang spears pierce all but the strongest armour. The force of their charge is mirrored in their endurance; steeled by a nomadic existence, these horsemen are relentless.	false
unit_description_historical_texts_text_placeholder	 	false
unit_description_historical_texts_text_3k_main_unit_water_onyx_dragons	The blade and bow have very different roles; the first is for close combat, while the second is to be used at long range to assault and harass targets from a safe distance. Masters of both, such as these Onyx Dragons, are valuable because of their versatility. \\n\\n Each soldier of this elite unit has earned their unique composite bow by proving exceptional accuracy and strength in archery, and has had more than a year’s training to ensure they wield their Jian swords with expert and deadly precision.	false
unit_description_historical_texts_text_3k_dlc07_unit_metal_northern_veteran_sabre_infantry	If a swordsman is a student of death upon the battlefield, then these veterans are surely the masters of it. With blades bloodied and bodies sharpened by years defending the northern border, the sabre infantry cut a bloody swathe through any who would oppose them. \\n\\n More heavily armoured than most of their comrades, these swordsmen are a rarer sight on the field, but a terrifying one to the opposing foe.	false
unit_description_historical_texts_text_3k_dlc06_unit_water_wuling_slingers	In the Five Valleys, terrain which would disrupt the march of most armies is a gentle stroll to those born and bred there. \\n\\n Though the range of their slings is limited, with their light armour and nimble feet the Wuling slingers can provide support from behind your front line, picking off enemies while staying safe themselves. 	false
unit_description_historical_texts_text_ep_unit_chu_spearmen	Spearmen are the bulk of any army, for anyone strong enough to hold a spear is strong enough to point it at the enemy, and march. Whilst peasant spearmen are given only the most basic of protection, professional warriors are afforded more robust equipment, giving them an edge. \\n\\n The Prince of Chu, Sima Wei, is known for his aggressive and tempestuous temperament; his forces, therefore, are blooded by battle and ready to march wherever he commands.	false
unit_description_historical_texts_text_3k_dlc04_unit_metal_imperial_sword_guard	The Northern Palace of Luoyang is the emperor's private residence; his sanctuary away from the noise and the pressures of court at the Southern Palace. It is also the most fiercely-defended place in all of China. \\n\\n The Imperial Sword Guard are equipped with dao blades, tower shields and heavy armour, meaning they can hold firm against any encroaching on imperial territory - they are the shield that guards the dynasty of heaven.	false
unit_description_historical_texts_text_3k_dlc07_unit_fire_northern_lancer_cavalry	Where the sabre cavalry excels in the involved, grizzly business of the melee, lancers are the shock warriors – their purpose being to break apart enemy formations, or neutralise the threat of enemy cavalry. \\n\\n Armed with a ji spear, these mounted warriors are well-armoured and swift, able to continue their pursuit even after the initial – and likely devastating – charge has taken its toll on the enemy.	false
unit_description_historical_texts_text_3k_dlc06_unit_metal_wugou_axe_throwers	The thrown weapon softens up the enemy: the more devastating the strike, the easier the task of finishing off the foe. \\n\\nClad in the distinctive rattan armour of Wutugu's forces, the Wuguo Axe Throwers show no fear. The moment they are in range, they hurl a pair of sharp-edged axes with deadly accuracy. Even those fast – or lucky – enough not to fall prey to the spinning blades may then have to face the axemen in hand-to-hand combat.	false
unit_description_historical_texts_text_3k_dlc04_unit_earth_imperial_household_cavalry	As part of the household cavalry, these soldiers are personally charged with defending the emperor and delivering the dynasty's justice to any who would take up arms against him. \\n\\n With their blades and shields they are able to charge into the fray of enemies and remain there, fighting effectively without the need to retreat and charge again. The Imperial Household Cavalry will stay the course, and battle the Han's enemies, to whatever end.	false
unit_description_historical_texts_text_3k_main_unit_wood_spear_guards	The most vulnerable parts of any army are its flanks; a surprise attack can easily decimate and panic the troops, causing a cascading effect which can break the hardest of hearts. \\n\\n Spear guardians protect the flanks by pre-empting charges and bracing their qiang spears at an angle, so only the most foolish or brave cavalry dare charge them. \\n\\n This makes them a target for missile attacks, so they are outfitted in leather armour and carry large shields to protect themselves from the expected rain of arrows.	false
unit_description_historical_texts_text_3k_main_unit_metal_sabre_infantry	The zhibeidao is a straight-bladed sword. Cheap and quick to master, it is a weapon ideal for equipping massed troops, particularly those with little training. \\n\\n Sabre Infantry are better trained than their militia counterparts, but their swords and purpose remain the same - to target less mobile enemies and engage with them in close combat, clearing the way for more specialist units.	false
unit_description_historical_texts_text_ep_unit_imperial_guard	When defending the emperor, only the most highly-trained and battle-hardened warriors will suffice. Imperial guards are essentially bulwarks; clad in heavy iron and equipped with huge, tower shields, they present a daunting obstacle to any force hoping to overcome them. \\n\\n Sima Liang's brief, but determined, tenure as imperial regent was defined by his staunch  defence of the emperor; an ardent calling that he heeds now, even in exile.	false
unit_description_historical_texts_text_3k_ytr_unit_wood_reclaimers	The role of these troops can be deduced from their appearance; their armour pieces are mismatched, put together by collecting those left in the aftermath of battle, or sourced from nearby villages. \\n\\n Their most important function is to search and collect loot, weapons and armour after the battle to put towards the Great Peace. They are armed with spears and shields in case they must defend themselves, or are needed to bolster numbers, but have little fighting skill and can easily be routed.	false
unit_description_historical_texts_text_3k_dlc06_unit_water_hidden_vipers	The King of Bald Dragon Ravine is not a general who lets any advantage go unexploited. Why field a unit who have only one type of weapon at their disposal when you can use a combination of missile and hand-to-hand attacks to keep the foe fully occupied?\\n\\nWhile the front line strike out with their machetes from behind the safety of their shields, the line of blowpipes firing from behind them sting the enemy from afar with their poisoned darts.	false
unit_description_historical_texts_text_3k_dlc07_unit_wood_northern_spear_guards	It is the spears that form the backbone of any army. An untrained, unprepared line of spearmen is akin to a weak, brittle spine; a cadre of well-trained spears, conversely, is a strong and ready force, able to weather whatever waves of battle that crash upon it. \\n\\n These spearmen, armed and armoured accordingly, form part of the northern army. As such, they are well-trained and blooded against northern invaders. If there is weakness amongst them, it is soon rooted out – one way or another.	false
unit_description_historical_texts_text_3k_main_unit_metal_jian_swordguards	The jian is a straight, double-edged sword known as the 'Gentleman of Weapons', and considered to be one of the four major weapons alongside the gun, dao and qiang. It takes a year of training before one is considered competent enough to use it, and so only the most skilled swordsmen are equipped with it. \\n\\n The role of the Jian Sword Guard is to hold the line against enemy attacks, and their swordsmanship, leather armour and gourd shields enable them to do this long after others have fallen to exhaustion.	false
unit_description_historical_texts_text_3k_dlc04_unit_wood_fervent_defenders	Every army must have a backbone - a core of dependable, if not exceptional, infantry to form the line of battle. Even in armies of more irregular composition, such as those fielded by the Yellow Turbans, this is a constant. \\n\\n These warriors assume that mantle, striding into battle with no exceptional traits, something which in itself makes them exceptional, though they have decent armour and are armed with standard polearms. Battle forms around them; unsung heroes in a cause filled with the exceptional and the bold.	false
unit_description_historical_texts_text_3k_dlc07_unit_fire_northern_veteran_lancers	Only the hardiest and boldest of warriors survive in war, let alone as lancers on the front line. With their spirits bathed in blood and tempered in war, these veteran riders are an exemplar to any other warrior who would sit upon a saddle, or couch a lance. \\n\\n With greater armour than their cavalry contemporaries, the adept cavalrymen are a destructive force upon the field, with a resolve and discipline that shatters enemy morale as much as any well-timed charge.	false
unit_description_historical_texts_text_3k_main_unit_water_yi_archers	A siyah is the rigid part of a bow, designed to increase and preserve the draw earlier, sustain the thrust upon firing, and give the arrow a final snap as it leaves the bow. The arrows fired therefore have an increased velocity and strength, making them very effective at puncturing through armour. \\n\\n Like many archers, these Yi troops can be vulnerable if attacked in close combat, but they are better trained than most, and have zhibeidao swords should they need to defend themselves.	false
unit_description_historical_texts_text_3k_dlc05_unit_wood_bandit_gang	Even in the most irregular of armies, a core of spearmen is essential to maintain an effective fighting force. This is no different for the bandits than it is for the Han. They are lightly-equipped, armed only with a spear and shield, and a fierce, but blind determination. Although they are a far cry from the elite spearmen of the empire, they fight no less fiercely for a lack of official training.	false
unit_description_historical_texts_text_3k_ytr_unit_water_yellow_turban_archers	The Yellow Turbans’ cause is shared by all people unfortunate enough to be born outside of nobility and power. \\n\\n Outlaws may be considered a scourge upon the land, but their professions – often undertaken by necessity – requires a quick eye and reflexes, and no little bravado to pull off daring raids. \\n\\n These former bandits’ morale and accuracy with the bow is much improved over any peasant archers they fight alongside. They also carry swords for close combat, but only draw them as a last resort.	false
unit_description_historical_texts_text_3k_dlc07_unit_metal_liyang_daring_infantry	Although these soldiers seek victory over death, they will run headlong into the jaws of destruction with little regard for their lives, in pursuit of the greater glory of their lord. These determined warriors are pushed by a manic zeal, which makes them more resistant to the strikes of their enemies. \\n\\n Employed best against an enemy fortification or to spring from an ambush, these warriors are swift, deadly, and utterly uncompromising.	false
unit_description_historical_texts_text_3k_main_unit_water_yi_marksmen	Yi Marksmen have proven their skill with the bow in both competitions and battle. They are armed with long siyah horn bows, which have extended siyahs to increase velocity and power of the arrows fired. \\n\\n Missile units are always a threat and tend to be eliminated quickly, so the marksmen are outfitted with leather armour and equipped with long zhibeidao swords to fend off enemy infantry attacks.	false
unit_description_historical_texts_text_3k_ytr_unit_wood_guardians_of_the_land	Guardians of the Land have chosen the protection and pursuit of the people over the protection of their corrupt former masters. Once palace guards and bodyguards for the elite few, they have abandoned their posts for the Great Peace – but not before raiding their old warlord’s armoury! \\n\\n It is an irony that the armour and ji polearms they use to unseat powerful warlords and their lackeys were often paid for by the very same, and that the training they use to defeat the enemy was received during their time guarding them.	false
unit_description_historical_texts_text_3k_main_unit_fire_peasant_raiders	Peasants own no land and can expect little from their future except hardship, so battle grants them some agency, no matter how short-lived. \\n\\n Their lack of armour is proof that their generals consider them expendable, but still they grit their teeth and grasp their fatalistic destiny as firmly as their spears, urging their horses into charging the enemy. \\n\\n Should they survive long enough, they will chase down fleeing enemies - boasting of their prowess upon returning to the fields.	false
unit_description_historical_texts_text_3k_main_unit_water_archer_captain	Militia are recruited quickly, armed and mobilised in mass numbers, without spending much time on training before deployment. Any conscript who demonstrates some ability in archery is given a composite bow and enlisted as an archer. \\n\\n These archers are considered useful to increase numbers, but less skilful than seasoned soldiers, and so are given zhibeidao swords for protection rather than armour. \\n\\n These straight-bladed swords are cheap but easily mastered, making them the perfect weapon for militia troops.	false
unit_description_historical_texts_text_3k_main_unit_water_mercenary_archers	In times of war and chaos, a skilled soldier can earn a substantial wage by hiring out their services. These mercenaries have fought are under many banners, and in many places, and are accustomed to fighting in hot climates. \\n\\n Where others suffer the heat and find their accuracy impaired by sluggishness, these mercenaries retain their focus. \\n\\n A mercenary is expected to provide their own equipment, and these professionals arrive for duty in the finest leather armour, carrying good quality composite bows and fu axes.	false
unit_description_historical_texts_text_3k_ytr_unit_water_peasant_archers	A call to arms, particularly against tyranny, is often answered by more than just the land’s heroes and warriors. The downtrodden need only to hear support for their plight to be galvanised into action, and these peasants have fashioned simple bows to join the Yellow Turban cause. \\n\\n They enter battle in flimsy tattered tunics and lack the skill, courage and eyes of seasoned archers, but if enough arrows are launched, no matter how poorly aimed, the deluge is bound to find some targets.	false
unit_description_historical_texts_text_3k_dlc04_unit_metal_peasant_volunteers	The Yellow Turban cause does not discriminate between the rich and poor, the noble and the peasant - all that matters is the desire to see the corrupt government overthrown and the people liberated from oppression. \\n\\n Armed with rakes, shovels and whatever can be found at short notice, these peasants cannot be relied upon to be effective in combat, or to hold their nerve against more experienced troops, but let none doubt their desire or their belief - it belief such as this that will bring ultimate victory.	false
unit_description_historical_texts_text_3k_main_unit_wood_infantry_of_jing	The most vulnerable parts of any army are its flanks; a surprise attack can easily decimate and panic the troops, causing a cascading effect which can break the hardest of hearts. \\n\\n The Infantry of Jing protect the flanks by pre-empting charges and bracing their qiang spears at an angle, so only the bravest or most foolish cavalry dare charge them. This makes them a target for missile attacks, so they are outfitted in leather armour and carry large shields to protect themselves from the expected rain of arrows.	false
unit_description_historical_texts_text_3k_dlc04_unit_wood_ji_defectors	An oppressed people will suffer and obey under  corrupt rulers only until such time as a viable alternative is presented to them. Then, with others who support their cause, they will gladly fight and die to free themselves from tyranny. \\n\\n Infantry carrying the ji polearm form the bulk of most Han forces. In fact, they are a vital component of any army, be it imperial or rebel. Certainly, their presence on the frontlines of a Yellow Turban army must be a worrisome sight for any government general.	false
unit_description_historical_texts_text_3k_main_unit_wood_defenders_of_hebei	When facing a powerful cavalry charge, these heavily-armoured troops plant their feet firmly, brace their ji polearms, and wait for the impact of enemy horses impaling themselves on the spear-tips. \\n\\n Once the momentum of the cavalry is spent, these warriors' iron armour protects them from the ensuing melee, and the curved blade and spear-tip of their polearms are used to pierce, hack and slash at the enemy, or used as a hook to catch and drag them from their mounts.	false
unit_description_historical_texts_text_3k_dlc04_unit_metal_exemplars_of_the_tao	It is in the hearts and minds of the people that the Yellow Turban's true victory will be won, but the battle must also be won on the field and the exemplars will stride forth to deliver to the Han their defeat. \\n\\n There are few better suited to pinning down enemy forces and deflecting blows with armour and shield, all the while returning any force dealt to them tenfold.	false
unit_description_historical_texts_text_3k_ytr_unit_water_archery_masters	If one can focus body and mind as one, almost anything can be achieved. \\n\\n Each of these archers has spent years mastering the bow for competition and concentration. With the addition of regular Taoist mediation, body and mind are in harmony, and each arrow launched hits with deadly accuracy. \\n\\n They carry a full complement of quivers and are best deployed at a distance from the enemy; instead of armour, they wear elegant robes and carry only the most basic swords should they be forced to defend themselves in close combat.	false
unit_description_historical_texts_text_3k_dlc04_unit_metal_qiang_warriors	When the need arises, a general should have no qualms about recruiting non-standard forces to aid in battle. The Qiang, a collection of tribal peoples from beyond the borders, are fierce warriors with unconventional fighting styles. \\n\\n Armed with dual axes or a heavy mace, Qiang warriors waste no time getting right into the centre of a melee, bludgeoning and dismembering with abandon and little regard for their own safety or lives.	false
unit_description_historical_texts_text_3k_ytr_unit_earth_yellow_turban_horsemen	Once a gang of brigands, bandits and outsiders, these horsemen have banded together for the Yellow Turbans’ cause. \\n\\n Their horses – many stolen or won in games of chance – are no match against other cavalry in terms of power, but are extremely fast, enabling them to rush to the aid of beleaguered allies or use their sabres in raiding attacks against unprotected archers. \\n\\n Some may be former thieves, but they fight to purge China of greater criminals; the corrupt landlords and warlords who exploit the people.	false
unit_description_historical_texts_text_3k_main_unit_fire_heavy_tiger_and_leopard_cavalry	Cao Cao’s Tiger and Leopard elite cavalry are the very best, and are equipped accordingly. Holding a qiang spear in one hand with a round shield in the other, they target enemies armed with long-range weapons. \\n\\n Though their full iron armour slows the speed of their mounts, along with their shields it provides robust protection from arrows and other projectiles as they close in on their prey. The extra weight of their armour adds a bone-crunching impact to their already devastating charges.	false
unit_description_historical_texts_text_3k_main_unit_water_fury_of_beihai	Archery takes years of training and immense upper-body strength to be able to draw back the string to the nocking point. Firing a crossbow needs the user to be taught only how to load a bolt and point it. Unlike notching an arrow, a crossbow bolt can be loaded easily, and once loaded, can be held until the user is ready to fire. \\n\\n Despite its ease of use, the draw weight increases the bolts speed and power when released, meaning that less skilled troops can be armed but still prove deadly on the battlefield.	false
unit_description_historical_texts_text_3k_dlc07_unit_wood_northern_ji_infantry_captain	Wherever the northern tribes seek to advance beyond the border, these elite ji infantrymen stand ready to turn them back. With a ferocity and natural discipline learned through generations of military excellence, these warriors continue to excel under the leadership of a renowned and capable officer. \\n\\n Battle-proven and hardy, they face their foes head on, leading with a stoic confidence that can only be earned through countless trials of blood and glorious victory.	false
unit_description_historical_texts_text_3k_dlc07_unit_earth_tiger_cubs	For every soldier who is selected to ride in the elite Tiger & Leopard cavalry, there are those who are not quite ready for such a responsibility. Fine warriors in their own right, these riders form the bulk of the Tiger Cubs. \\n\\n Their name is perhaps overly mollifying, as they fight with a ferocity and a power greater than most other cavalries in the land. For when the Tiger Cubs roar, it is only the enemy who mewls in fear.	false
unit_description_historical_texts_text_3k_dlc04_unit_wood_defenders_of_the_empire	To some, the integrity of the ruling dynasty is paramount. Such people will march to war in its name and die defending its ideals. \\n\\n The Defenders of the Empire stride to battle in thick armour, with a shield to brace against enemy attacks. On the frontlines, they deliver Han justice at the point of a spear.	false
unit_description_historical_texts_text_3k_dlc04_unit_earth_chen_peacekeepers	Prince Liu Chong is resolved that his lands in Chen will be a haven from the storm that threatens to rage through China. To this end, a strong economy and local government must be backed by a powerful and devoted military. \\n\\n Peacekeepers are mobile, mounted warriors, with solid, round shields and swords for charging into enemy formations and, once engaged, remaining in the fray. Chen will be defended only by the best, the most powerful and those with the self-same adventuring spirit of their liege. 	false
unit_description_historical_texts_text_3k_dlc07_unit_wood_northern_spear_guard_captain	The captain of the spear guard demands the respect of both ally and enemy alike. If the cavalry and infantrymen are the unstoppable force of the northern army, these spearmen serve as the immovable object against which waves of their foes will break. \\n\\n More than capable of leading any garrison, they are the unbreakable shield that guards the border, determined that no threat shall breech their defences.	false
unit_description_historical_texts_text_3k_dlc04_unit_water_multiple_bolt_crossbow	At a glance, this siege weapon appears to be the simple crossbow, yet bigger than before – and far, far more powerful. Its ten-foot long bolts, when fired, are powerful enough to cleave through ranks of soldiery, and thus are devastating against enemy lines. \\n\\n Loading more than one bolt per crossbow requires a significant amount more effort and reduces the accuracy of the weapon. However, when firing indiscriminately into advancing enemy lines, accuracy is secondary – by an order of magnitude – to raw destructive power.	false
unit_description_historical_texts_text_3k_dlc07_unit_water_ye_vanguard_crossbows	The crossbow is dangerous not only because of its innate destructive potential, but because it can be used with the bare minimum of training. Unlike a composite bow, which requires expert training to be used effectively, all a crossbowman need know is how to knock and ready the weapon; then it is as simple as pulling the trigger. \\n\\n If the weapon is combined with a warrior of passing or even exceptional skill, then a cadre of crossbowmen become a fearful force on the battlefield!	false
unit_description_historical_texts_text_ep_unit_xianbei_riders	The Xianbei are a nomadic people who spent much of their history in thrall to more powerful nomads, such as the Xiongnu. They raided across imperial lands as the Han dynasty weakened, but were eventually curtailed by the cunning Cao Cao. \\n\\n Clad in leather armour and armed with ji polearms, these riders are highly mobile, excelling at striking enemy flanks, impaling foes upon their spears or crushing them beneath their horse's hooves.	false
unit_description_historical_texts_text_3k_dlc07_unit_earth_xiongnu_noble_cavalry	The Xiongnu are a nomadic people hailing from north of China. They were nominally tributaries to the previous dynasty, yet remained unruly and insolent to the Han emperors until their tempestuous tempers were finally tamed, and they were deployed in the armies the Han warlords. \\n\\n The Xiongnu live their lives in the saddle, and as such their cavalry is always prepared. It is said that cavalry is the foundation of military power; if so, the Xiongnu are truly mighty indeed!	false
unit_description_historical_texts_text_3k_main_unit_fire_mounted_lancer_militia	 The best armour is reserved for skilled warriors, but these conscripts have proven to be competent enough to warrant partial leather armour and ji polearms. \\n\\n Their role is not to engage in the kind of extended close combat that would require heavier armour, but rather remain light and use the speed of their mounts to shock enemy lines with swift cavalry charges and chase down routers.	false
unit_description_historical_texts_text_ep_unit_chu_infantry	Armed with single-bladed dao swords designed for slashing and chopping, infantry have the vital task of locking down and clearing away less mobile enemies such as spearmen, allowing other forces to press the attack. \\n\\n The Prince of Chu, Sima Wei, is known for his aggressive and tempestuous temperament; his forces, therefore, are blooded by battle and ready to march wherever he commands.	false
unit_description_historical_texts_text_ep_unit_dao_swordguard_cavalry	Unlike shock cavalry, which are deployed to devastate enemy lines with repeated, bone-shattering charges, sword cavalry are designed to remain in the melee, holding against the enemy with shield and sword. \\n\\n the dao, a single-edged blade, is used mainly for slicing and chopping at enemies, and has almost entirely replaced the double-edged jian in common Jin armies. Cavalry, however, have long used a form of dao, as wide, sweeping slashes from horseback are more effective than skewering thrusts.	false
unit_description_historical_texts_text_3k_dlc06_unit_water_nanman_slingers	The Nanman are a simple but resourceful people, used to making the best of whatever is to hand, whether they are cultivating their crops or seeing off invaders.  \\n\\nTake a twisted thong of animal hide or plant fibres, select a few stones of the right size and weight and you have a weapon which is concealable, lightweight and durable. A lone shot from a sling may only be an inconvenience, but being pelted with a hundred or more stones will stop any warrior in their tracks.	false
unit_description_historical_texts_text_3k_ytr_unit_metal_peoples_warband	Merchants have long been branded a ‘necessary evil’ by hypocritical warlords, who themselves line their pockets by abusing their power and exploiting the peasant classes. \\n\\n Though better off than the poor and starving peasants, concerned merchants and craftsmen have formed a group to fight back against tyranny. \\n\\n Each carry dual sabres and armour pieces looted from the city armouries of rich warlords, and though untrained, their numbers and commitment to the cause make them effective infantry on the field.	false
unit_description_historical_texts_text_3k_dlc06_unit_metal_valley_tribesmen	Metal armour is a luxury, one few in the less affluent lands of the south can afford. However, the men who have always lived in these valleys and mountains have their own unique way of protecting themselves. Their armour and shields are constructed from the leaves and fibres of the rattan plant, which provides a surprisingly good defence, especially against missiles. \\n\\nArmed with tools of the field turned into weapons of war, these peasant soldiers can acquit themselves well in battle.	false
unit_description_historical_texts_text_3k_main_unit_metal_rapid_tiger_infantry	The jian is a straight, double-edged sword known as the 'Gentleman of Weapons’ and considered to be one of the four major weapons alongside the gun, dao and qiang. It takes a year of training before one is considered competent enough to use it, and so only the most skilled swordsmen are equipped with it. \\n\\n The role of the Rapid Tiger Infantry is to hold the line against enemy attacks, and their swordsmanship, leather armour and gourd shields enable them to do this long after others have fallen to exhaustion.	false
unit_description_historical_texts_text_3k_main_unit_wood_ji_infantry_captain	Spears are an effective defence against enemy cavalry, but can also be used offensively as well. These infantry troops grip their qiang spears in both hands and put their weight behind the weapon to pierce armour and drive it through to the enemy inside. \\n\\n Outfitted in partial iron armour, they are somewhat protected against enemy assaults, meaning they can concentrate on defeating their quarry.	false
unit_description_historical_texts_text_3k_main_unit_earth_sabre_cavalry	The advantage of sabre cavalry troops lies in their mobility and versatility; partial iron armour and finely-woven rattan shields protect them from arrow attacks as they close the distance between enemy archers. \\n\\n Once they catch up, they quickly cut their foes down with straight-edged zhibeidao swords. These swords also prove effective against enemy cavalry, so Sabre Cavalry can race across the battlefield to intercept their equivalents and defend vulnerable allies.	false
unit_description_historical_texts_text_3k_main_unit_fire_lance_cavalry	These cavalry target not only the bodies of their enemies, but their morale as well. Crouched low on their mounts, ji polearms clutched tightly under their arms, they charge hard and fast into enemies with the aim of striking fear and forcing them to rout from the battlefield. \\n\\n Once a charge is completed, they can ride out of range of retaliation and prepare for their next assault. Their iron armour provides some protection in close combat, but they remain vulnerable in sustained encounters and to missile attack.	false
unit_description_historical_texts_text_3k_main_unit_water_thunder_of_jian_an	Good armour can provide some protection against arrows but offers little against the power and momentum of a crossbow bolt. The 'Thunder of Jian’an' are considered the best crossbow troops and are equipped with better armour than their equivalents to protect them in close combat. \\n\\n The draw weight of a crossbow increases the speed and power of the bolt when released, and the mechanism means that a bolt can be loaded and held indefinitely until the user is ready to fire.	false
unit_description_historical_texts_text_3k_main_unit_wood_black_mountain_outlaws	The only way to counteract an enemy cavalry charge is to wait until the horses are close and brace with long spears. \\n\\n A horse at full gallop can easily break the staunchest of defences, so the trick is to use their speed, weight and power against them so that they pierce themselves upon the points of the spears. \\n\\n These bandits possess the courage needed for such a strategy and are brave enough to sneak into enemy territory and capture key strategic points.	false
unit_description_historical_texts_text_3k_ytr_unit_metal_scholar_warriors	A soldier’s will must be as sure as their combat skills, or they will flee at the first threat of defeat. \\n\\n These scholars have spent as much time studying the sacred texts of the Tao as improving their swordsmanship with sabres; their knowledge of the Tao is complete, leaving no room for doubt. \\n\\n Without a weakness in their philosophy for the enemy to exploit, they cannot be routed. Their fighting prowess, devoutness and resplendent ornate robes inspire courage among their allies on the field.	false
unit_description_historical_texts_text_3k_ytr_unit_fire_white_wave_horsemen	These rebels arrive from the White Wave Valley ready to continue their war against tyrannical warlords. Fearlessly charging their horses at enemy lines, they thrust spears forward while keeping their shields pressed close to their bodies. \\n\\n Once engaged, they can stay to press the advantage, but fare better if they withdraw quickly to safety and prepare another charge. Years of resistance have also taught them the art of stealth, enabling them to deploy behind enemy lines prior to a battle.	false
unit_description_historical_texts_text_3k_main_unit_water_mercenary_archers_captain	In times of war and chaos, a skilled soldier can earn a substantial wage by hiring out their services. These mercenaries have fought are under many banners, and in many places, and are accustomed to fighting in hot climates. \\n\\n Where others suffer the heat and find their accuracy impaired by sluggishness, these mercenaries retain their focus. \\n\\n A mercenary is expected to provide their own equipment, and these professionals arrive for duty in the finest leather armour, carrying good quality composite bows and fu axes.	false
unit_description_historical_texts_text_3k_dlc04_unit_water_chen_royal_guard	Although not in line for the Han throne, Liu Chong is nevertheless a prince of the dynasty and an administrator beside. It is only just, therefore, that he be given a royal retinue of elite soldiers to protect him. \\n\\n The royal guard hold fast behind heavy, large shields, thrusting with spears from behind their defensive cover. However, before the enemy even reaches striking distance, they have been assaulted by the guard's crossbows. These warriors will slay thousands in the name of prince and dynasty.	false
unit_description_historical_texts_text_3k_main_unit_earth_mounted_sabre_militia	Militia are raised for emergency defence, and have less weapon training than warriors destined for the battlefield. Therefore, they are armed with zhibeidao swords, reliable, straight-bladed weapons that are easily mastered and used from horseback to swipe and slice at the enemy below. \\n\\n As militia, they lack expensive or heavy armour, having only partial-leather, and are instead equipped with cheap, but durable rattan shields made from flexible rattan vines.	false
unit_description_historical_texts_text_3k_main_unit_water_archers	There is little protection against the devastating power of a cavalry charge - the surest defence is to prevent enemy cavalry from even getting close to its target. \\n\\n An unrelenting rain of arrows will slow even the bravest of horses and blunt the force of their charge, if not kill them outright. This requires archers of equal strength and accuracy; strength to pull back and load the bow, and accuracy to loose the arrow with quick precision.	false
unit_description_historical_texts_text_3k_dlc07_unit_wood_northern_ji_infantry	The Han's establishment of a professional, semi-permanent fighting force did not create a vast army, but a well-trained one. This northern army was made to resist invasions from beyond the border. \\n\\n These warriors are experts with the ji spear, and well-armoured besides. They will hold the line better than any locally-trained militia, for they have earned their skills with blood, pushing back the tribes of the mountains.	false
unit_description_historical_texts_text_3k_dlc06_unit_water_nanzhong_elephants	To recruit elephants to your cause is a coup, however you choose to use them. An elephant's size and might are a natural advantage; all who cross its path must make getting out of the way a priority or else suffer the consequences. \\n\\nHowever, Meng Huo's elephants have an additional edge, as the drummers on their backs beat time to inspire, support and encourage his troops.	false
unit_description_historical_texts_text_3k_ytr_unit_wood_peasant_spearmen	Starving and garbed in rags, these peasants have low morale, no training and no armour. Still they volunteer for battle, gathered by the Yellow Turban rallying call that travelled word-of-mouth through the fields from peasant to peasant. \\n\\n Bamboo usually harvested for the profit of exploitative landowners is sharpened into makeshift weapons, turning the products of oppression against the oppressors. Stakes are braced against the enemy cavalry that tower above as these spearmen pray that numbers will overwhelm stronger forces.	false
unit_description_historical_texts_text_3k_dlc06_unit_wood_shields_of_the_south	The deep ravines of the Nanman lands breed tough fighters. Protected against missiles and all but the hardest blows by their rattan armour, the sight of these warriors in any army will lift the hearts of those who fight alongside them. \\n\\nAs though the encasement in rattan were not enough, their massive shields deflect attacks as easily as a mountain deflects a gale. Then, from behind the safety of these formidable defences, they advance, spears in hand.	false
unit_description_historical_texts_text_3k_main_unit_metal_sabre_militia	Straight-bladed zhibeidao swords are cheap and easily mastered, making them the perfect weapon for militia. As little training is needed, these troops can be quickly recruited, armed and sent out to battle. \\n\\n Their lack of heavy armour leaves them vulnerable to cavalry, but provides some defence against archers. Their main use is to assault less mobile enemies, particularly spearmen, to open up the lines for a cavalry charge.	false
unit_description_historical_texts_text_3k_main_unit_water_qiang_hunters	The demands of a nomadic existence have given these Qiang hunters stamina and archery skills; their fine horn bows are made with long siyahs to increase and sustain the velocity of their shots, while their accuracy has been honed hunting animals in the wild. \\n\\n If fighting enemy infantry, their leather armour may put them at a disadvantage in regards to protection, but the gou lian dao polearms they carry are long enough to be excellent at warding and counter-attacking enemy horses.	false
unit_description_historical_texts_text_3k_dlc05_unit_earth_handmaid_guard	The Sun family has a proud history of powerful warriors, men and women who will live, and fight, and die in the service of their family and their ideals. The presence of powerful warrior women of the Sun family – Sun Ren, particularly – inspired those other women who could fight to do so. \\n\\n As bodyguards for nobles, the Handmaid Guard are particularly fearsome, able to stand toe-to-toe with any of China's best fighters.	false
unit_description_historical_texts_text_3k_dlc04_unit_wood_qiang_polearms	They say that a branch of the Qiang people moved east into the lands of the Han many centuries ago, choosing to live independently, maintaining livestock on their own, owing no allegiance or tithes to them. \\n\\n They also forge their own weapons and armour - bows and knives, armour and lances. Whilst they have been known to rise in defiance of the government, they are a transient people, and so it is not uncommon for them to also draw their weapons alongside the Han and fight in their defence.	false
unit_description_historical_texts_text_3k_dlc04_unit_water_archer_defectors	Orders are delivered, blunt and direct, from a commander, yet promises from others carry more weight in troubled times. The bulk of any Han army is composed of conscripts, drafted to fight for their lord. \\n\\n Yet when the message of the Yellow Turbans is aimed directly at the struggling populace, their loyalties may understandably waver. Though inexperienced, their defection robs the Han of soldiers and provides another string to the rebellion's increasingly-mighty bow.	false
unit_description_historical_texts_text_3k_dlc07_unit_water_dongzhoubing_marksmen	Raining down arrows from a distance is a sure way to thin an enemy's ranks before any swordsman has shed a single drop of blood. With an uncanny accuracy – no matter the terrain –  these marksmen pride themselves on their arrows striking true. \\n\\n In scant armour, however, they stand little chance in melee, and their reckless harassment of the local populace has left many desiring to cut them down. Thus dependent on Liu Yan for protection, their dedication to his cause can be in no doubt.	false
unit_description_historical_texts_text_3k_dlc06_unit_wood_javelin_spear_guards	The Javelin Spear Guards are a living demonstration of why their master is such a survivor, and has held on to power over long and tumultous years.. \\n\\nHis top warriors can throw their spears, defend themselves with their shields, and engage in hand-to-hand fighting with great effect. Fighting alongside such versatile and highly-skilled soldiers can raise an army to new heights.	false
unit_description_historical_texts_text_3k_dlc06_unit_fire_southern_elephants	Some call the men of Bana Ravine barbarians, with their command of beasts and their love of the sorcerous arts; their master, King Mulu, is said to go to war on the back of a white elephant. \\n\\nOpinions may differ on how civilised he and his bold folk are, but the opinion of outsiders means little when you are firing down on your foes from the back of an elephant, while the beast you control tramples the fleeing enemy underfoot. 	false
unit_description_historical_texts_text_3k_ytr_unit_wood_bringers_of_righteousness	These concerned citizens call themselves the Bringers of Righteousness and have used their wealth to purchase their own armour and weapons. Each has undertaken extensive training to become proficient using ji polearms and learned how to use a bow through traditional archery competitions. \\n\\n Though they wear expensive tunics, their commitment is not mere vainglory; their not-inconsiderable skill with the bow and ji make them extremely useful due to their flexibility, and therefore welcomed to join the fight for the Great Peace.	false
unit_description_historical_texts_text_3k_dlc04_unit_metal_sabre_defectors	Loyalty endures only as long as belief in a cause lasts. If that belief should waver, then loyalty shall follow. However, the Yellow Turban message speaks of rebellion and liberation from oppression; no man so long under the heel could be blamed for defecting. \\n\\n With dao sabres in hand, these warriors donate their might to the Yellow Turban cause, not only bolstering the rebellion's ranks, but robbing the Han of valuable power as well.	false
unit_description_historical_texts_text_3k_dlc07_unit_earth_northern_veteran_sabre_cavalry	The horse is a trusted and beloved, but oft-skittish companion on the battlefield. Not so with these cavalry, whose riders and steeds both are veterans, tested and forged in the fires of war. \\n\\n Much like their other mounted comrades, these sabre cavalry excel in the melee, but are fashioned in even better armour befitting of their station. Their redoubtable discipline means they can be deployed about the battlefield with a devastatingly effective ease.	false
unit_description_historical_texts_text_3k_ytr_unit_metal_peasant_warriors	Emboldened by the Yellow Turban movement, these oppressed peasants grab whatever they can find to arm themselves and abandon their farmlands for the frontlines. \\n\\n During battle, their low morale means they can be easily routed, and instead of armour they have only the ragged tunics worn when toiling over crops. However, their motives remain of the purest kind, they are cheap and numerous to raise, and in large enough numbers can still be useful in charging and swamping the enemy’s flanks.	false
unit_description_historical_texts_text_3k_main_unit_wood_heavy_ji_infantry	When facing a powerful cavalry charge, these heavily-armoured troops plant their feet firmly, brace their ji polearms, and wait for the impact of enemy horses impaling themselves on the spear-tips. \\n\\n Once the momentum of the cavalry is spent, these warriors' iron armour protects them from the ensuing melee, and the curved blade and spear-tip of their polearms are used to pierce, hack and slash at the enemy, or used as a hook to catch and drag them from their mounts.	false
unit_description_historical_texts_text_3k_dlc06_unit_metal_nanman_warriors	The colourful and varied southern men who hunt and farm these lands have always lived here; they were well established even before the Shang founded their first kingdom. Though Nanman territory has been claimed by many rulers over the centuries, their warriors will only take up arms on their own terms. \\n\\nNeither sophisticated behaviour nor great skill are to be expected from these wild peoples, but they will fight with great heart, with axe or mace in hand.	false
unit_description_historical_texts_text_3k_dlc04_unit_fire_righteous_vanguards	To be the bolt of justice, to spearhead a charge deep into the enemy lines, delivering vengeance for an oppressed people, this is the task of these warriors. \\n\\n Although not as powerful as some shock cavalry, these vanguards can boast of their endurance; once they have ploughed into an enemy formation with their spears, they have the armour and the skill to keep fighting, thrusting with enough force to pierce most armour with righteous intensity.	false
unit_description_historical_texts_text_3k_dlc05_unit_metal_bandit_warriors	Banditry is not known for its elegance or even its order; it is a patchwork affair that makes use of whatever is at hand. So, too, are bandit warriors a pragmatic sort, fighting with whatever comes to hand. \\n\\n These fighters, sometimes little more than a rabble, have been known to charge into battles with two axes in hand, or two maces, or a mace and an axe, or even a ji! When it comes to weapons, they do not discriminate.	false
unit_description_historical_texts_text_3k_dlc04_unit_fire_imperial_lancer_cavalry	From the gates of the Southern and Northern Palaces, to the White Horse Temple, Imperial Lancer Cavalry will pursue any so brazen as to threaten the dynasty's seat of power. \\n\\n Armed with a two-handed lance and wearing heavy armour, they are a resplendent demonstration of imperial power. When the lance is couched and the horse at full charge, a unit of lancers can devastate an enemy line, shattering both bodies and resolve in equal measure.	false
unit_description_historical_texts_text_3k_dlc06_unit_water_javelin_throwers	Warriors in the service of Yang Feng need to be adaptable, given their master's propensity for fighting for, alongside, or against such a variety of foes. \\n\\nTheir skills with the thrown javelin are exceptional, as befits such experienced soldiers, but they are no fools. They carry shields to defend themselves, and will hold back their final javelin, using it as a spear should they be called on to fight hand-to-hand.	false
unit_description_historical_texts_text_3k_main_unit_metal_mercenary_infantry_captain	Victory in battle is decided not only on the strength and skills of soldiers, but on strategic control of the field. These mercenaries fight for gold, not out of loyalty, so when ordered to capture a key strategic point they put all efforts towards it or risk not getting paid. \\n\\n Offering their services to the highest bidder, their travels have acclimatised them to even the most punishing heat. Upon accepting a contract, they arrive fully equipped with fine leather armour, rattan shields and good quality fu axes.	false
unit_description_historical_texts_text_3k_dlc04_unit_wood_zealots_of_the_way	Where the militia of the Han are pressed into service out of obligation, the Yellow Turban zealots rise to fight because it is the only way to carve a better future for the people. \\n\\n Their fierce determination makes them more effective than standard militia. They charge into battle, lightly-armoured and equipped with glaives, ready to rend asunder any who doubt or question the Way.	false
unit_description_historical_texts_text_3k_main_unit_water_heavy_repeating_crossbowmen	Repeating crossbows have a magazine to reduce the loading and drawing of bolts; though some power is lost, it is compensated by the weapon’s ability to fire a rapid barrage of ammunition and its increased accuracy, as the wielder can use both hands to steady their aim. \\n\\n These crossbowmen are outfitted with full iron armour, which increases their chances of survival against enemy assault, and zhibeidao swords for close combat, though their skills lie in firing the crossbow, not swordsmanship.	false
unit_description_historical_texts_text_3k_main_unit_water_mounted_archers	These cavalry troops may not have the finest of weapons, but the ability to fire arrows from horseback while keeping out of reach from the enemy makes them incredibly useful on the battlefield. Their horses are trained not to panic amid the din and chaos of battle, but instinctively retreat from encroaching enemies. \\n\\n Should the enemy manage to corner these troops, they wear partial iron armour and are armed with zhibeidao swords so that they can defend themselves until permitted to pull back.	false
unit_description_historical_texts_text_3k_dlc04_unit_water_yaoguai_hunters	'Yaoguai' are said to be demons and spirits that, through Taoist practice, have gained form and magical powers, and seek immortality. 'Guai' - or 'demon' - are malevolent in their intent; difficult to see, yet powerful and dangerous. \\n\\n The Yaoguai Hunters are so named because they are inspired by that same dark intent - to strike, unseen, wreaking havoc and destruction then fading back into the air.	false
unit_description_historical_texts_text_3k_dlc06_unit_water_sanjiang_poison_darts	Wise King Duosi is a master of inventiveness in war, said to even use the land itself against his enemies. His warriors take after their lord, striking from the shadows, unseen, unheard, only revealed by the damage they do. \\n\\nShould their foes survive the unexpected bite of a silent, poison-tipped dart, these warriors will engage the foe openly, striking down those who escaped their missiles with their clubs, before melting away again. 	false
unit_description_historical_texts_text_3k_dlc06_unit_metal_tiger_warriors	Animals have always been drafted to the cause of war. From horses to pull chariots and provide mounts for cavalry, to dogs eager to hunt down any foe their master sets them upon. \\n\\nBut to face a wild animal backed up by a handler who is a formidable warrior in their own right is to face death. When that animal is a tiger, the paragon of courage, strength and ferocity, then doom is sure to follow. 	false
unit_description_historical_texts_text_3k_dlc04_unit_fire_mounted_lancer_defectors	The lance of one you once called brother causes considerably more damage than that of any other; the Yellow Turban message has caused many a lance to be turned and destroy bonds once-thought unbreakable. \\n\\n The mounted lancer is a terror on the battlefield. As they are lightly armoured, they are able to move swiftly and strike with great force against any foe. They are particularly effective at neutralising other cavalry and chasing down fleeing infantry who, much like the Han, will be hounded from the land.	false
unit_description_historical_texts_text_3k_main_unit_fire_tiger_and_leopard_cavalry	Only the very best soldiers are selected for Cao Cao’s elite Tiger and Leopard cavalry. Each one has previously led one-hundred soldiers and is counted among the best riders in the land. \\n\\n They are outfitted with partial iron armour and the finest qiang spears and shields, enabling them to close the distance on, and neutralise, long-range enemies. \\n\\n As befitting their elite status, these cavalry are highly disciplined, and will continue to fight on when others have admitted defeat.	false
unit_description_historical_texts_text_3k_main_unit_water_heavy_crossbowmen	A crossbow does not require the upper body strength and skill needed of archers; the bolt is simply loaded into the chamber and fired directly at the target. \\n\\n The bolts have more impact on their targets because of the increased draw-weight, and as they have the momentum to travel in a straight line, trajectory does not need to be calculated.  \\n\\n These troops are heavily armoured in iron, and in close combat use their zhibeidao swords to slash at the enemy.	false
unit_description_historical_texts_text_3k_dlc04_unit_wood_territorial_spearmen	Some fight for their families and for their homes; others because it is all they have ever known. No matter the reason, when defending ones homeland, weapons will be fashioned from anything available and put to use with desperate intent. \\n\\n Bamboo, in all its abundance, is perfect for the warrior in need of a makeshift polearm. Strong yet flexible, bamboo takes much to break, yet when sharpened at one end has sufficient fortitude to pierce armour and flesh alike.	false
unit_description_historical_texts_text_3k_dlc04_unit_metal_imperial_guard_captain	When defending the emperor, only the most highly-trained and battle-hardened warriors will suffice. Imperial guards are essentially bulwarks; clad in heavy iron and equipped with huge, tower shields, they present a daunting obstacle to any force hoping to overcome them.	false
unit_description_historical_texts_text_3k_dlc06_unit_metal_wuling_fighters	The men of the Five Valleys do not fear the sheer drop or the rough mountain pass. These places produce tough soldiers who will fight on when soft lowlanders fail and fall. \\n\\nArmed with a shield as a concession to defence, and a machete which serves as survival tool or weapon as required, Wuling's fighting men love nothing more than to take down a hero who has foolishly come to believe their own legend.  	false
unit_description_historical_texts_text_3k_main_unit_fire_xiliang_cavalry	Defeat the hearts and courage of your opponents and the lion's share of the battle is already won. Xiliang cavalry specialise in devastating charges against the enemy, and any troops that don’t fall to their horses and spears sustain grave wounds to their morale. \\n\\n A fast charge into waiting enemy lines requires great courage, and these battle-hardened troops are almost impossible to route through fear alone. 	false
unit_description_historical_texts_text_ep_unit_cataphracts	Cataphracts are, in essence, heavily-armoured horses - so heavily-armoured, in fact, that the steed itself becomes as much a weapon as anything held by the rider. \\n\\n The sheer weight of the horse's armour and momentum is used to drive through enemy lines, breaking their defences and exposing vulnerabilities. Cataphracts are also deeply demoralising - the sight of metal-clad horses bearing down upon you is a truly terrifying final sight before death!	false
unit_description_historical_texts_text_ep_unit_warriors_of_xu	Whilst a sword or a spear can be considered to be relatively elegant weapons of war, the axe has no such pretence; it is an instrument of death, and those who wield them are brutal experts. In the business of war, it is might that so often determines victory, not sophistication. \\n\\n These warriors, under the direction of Sima Yue, are used as shock troops, terrifying enemies as they bear down upon them, and devastating them as their axes cleave easily through flesh, muscle and bone.	false
unit_description_historical_texts_text_ep_unit_archers_of_jing	Along with spearmen, archers form the spine of any army. With sufficient training and physical strength even the lowest peasant can learn to draw, aim and fire - accuracy is less important when one arrow becomes one hundred. \\n\\n These archers are far more than peasants, however; under the leadership of Sima Ai, they are better trained and better armoured. Additionally, they are armed with a dao, for should the melee come to them, they will be ready to defend themselves to the death!	false
unit_description_historical_texts_text_3k_main_unit_fire_mercenary_cavalry	If a soldier fights for gold, rather than out of loyalty, then they are expected to serve with excellence and earn their pay. For the right price, these cavalry troops will arrive for battle armed with exceptional qiang spears and clad in fine leather armour. \\n\\n Hardened by years of fighting under many banners, they can still fight well in the blistering heat, and their mobility is especially useful for racing in and capturing key strategic points.	false
unit_description_historical_texts_text_3k_dlc05_unit_fire_formation_breakers	The formation of a battle line, its fundamental structure, is key to the successs of an army. Should the line falter, then the army too will likely follow. Units that can succesfully, and consistently, devastate formations are some of the most crucial on the battlefield. \\n\\n Gao Shun, an authoritative, uncompromising man, leads such a force. His forces are elite, with a proven record of breaking apart enemy lines. With such openings created, an army flows through as water through a broken dam.	false
unit_description_historical_texts_text_3k_dlc07_unit_wood_dongzhoubing_defenders	With spear and shield, these well armoured infantrymen are ferocious in battle, steadfast in the defence of their general. Originally recruited to fight Dong Zhuo, their blades instead have become the tools by which Liu Yan pursues his own ambitions. \\n\\n Unruly and undisciplined, this unit sows fear and discontent wherever they tread. Yet whatever they may lack in restraint, they make up for in unwavering loyalty to Liu Yan and his interests. 	false
unit_description_historical_texts_text_3k_dlc05_unit_metal_white_tiger_warriors	The tiger does not hunt alone, and when it strikes, it strikes with the strength of thousands. The White Tiger Warriors follow their leader, Yan Baihu, into battle no matter the cost and no matter the result. \\n\\n Those who follow the White Tiger do so with an unwavering zeal – it was he who offered them a home and purpose, and encourages any and all to fight back against marching Han warlords, and to defend their homes.	false
unit_description_historical_texts_text_ep_unit_heavy_mounted_archers	Mounted archers provide a general with an invaluable advantage: the ability to rain arrows down upon an enemy whilst staying safely out of reach of counter-attacks. Their horses are trained not to buck or flee in the furore of combat, giving the archers unparalleled versatility. \\n\\n Should the melee somehow reach them, however, these warriors are better prepared than other mounted archers, armed with plate mail to deflect blows, and dao swords with which to fight back.	false
unit_description_historical_texts_text_3k_main_unit_wood_azure_dragons	Azure Dragons share the strengths of long-ranged troops without suffering their major weakness. \\n\\n Using uniquely-crafted composite bows, they loose a volley of arrows with the accuracy and strength of seasoned archers, while their gou lian dao polearms and heavy iron armour protects their flanks against enemy charges. \\n\\n It is this skill with the bow, while being able to defend themselves in close combat, that makes them a fearsome and versatile threat to the enemy on the battlefield.	false
unit_description_historical_texts_text_3k_main_unit_wood_ji_infantry	To guard against a cavalry charge use the horse’s momentum and weight against them; brace long polearms at an angle and await the charge so the horses pierce themselves on the waiting defences. \\n\\n A ji polearm has an angled blade attached to the top and a spear added to the tip, making it a versatile weapon for hooking and dismounting cavalry or slashing at riders. \\n\\n While these troops brace themselves against cavalry charges, their own hides are protected by iron armour.	false
unit_description_historical_texts_text_3k_dlc04_unit_wood_stalwart_shields	Some warriors are sent into battle to charge furiously against the enemy frontline, yet others live to follow that charge and cut the weakened foe to ribbons. Yet others still excel at holding fast against the enemy, never giving any ground whilst not advancing themselves. \\n\\n These warriors, clad in hardened leather armour, hold their large, metal-braced shields before them, and come what may, they hold the line. Particularly effective at stopping arrow fire, these stalwart warriors absorb the brunt of enemy fire, creating opportunities for other warriors to press forward.	false
unit_description_historical_texts_text_3k_dlc04_unit_metal_redeemed_outlaws	A war against an oppressive, corrupt government cannot be won by using the same tools or warriors. Those who have been condemned by the Han - outlaws and bandits - are proffered the hand of mercy, in exchange for their blades in the coming battles. \\n\\n Outlaws are not hardened soldiers, lacking the heavy armour and skill of trained warriors, yet they have temerity and battlefield experience. Although their fight may be short, they will certainly fight with their all.	false
unit_description_historical_texts_text_3k_dlc04_unit_water_archer_gang	Those who hear and believe in the Yellow Turban cause also know that they must fight to see their futures realised. They may be of insignificant stock and lacking in any real martial training, yet all the same they must rise to fight. \\n\\n Lightly armoured and handed a bow, these warriors take aim at the warriors of a corrupt dynasty and pray their aim is true. If it is not, however, there are always many more arrows to be loosed.	false
unit_description_historical_texts_text_3k_dlc04_unit_earth_jaizi_raiders	For the territorial warrior, raiding is a way of life – they strike hard and fast, then fall back with the spoils of their conquest. The nomadic tribes of China know this life and how it can be applied to more conventional warfare. \\n\\n Although fast, the raiders are armoured with heavy metal and wield swords, meaning that when in melee they can stay there and continue pressing the attack. For these warriors, battle, once begun, ends either in death, glory or both.	false
unit_description_historical_texts_text_3k_dlc05_unit_water_bandit_hunters	As war becomes more advanced, weaponry becomes more easy to use for the common, untrained peasant. Yet some would say the old ways are still the best. The bow, although easy to pick up, is notoriously difficult to master, and only the finest become sharpshooters of legend. \\n\\n Many bandit hunters are those who abandoned their life in the Han, yet others know nothing of military training. These warriors honed their skill hunting animals, and now turn their trade to the business of war.	false
unit_description_historical_texts_text_3k_dlc06_unit_fire_war_elephants	The elephants of King Mulu make their mark on any battle. \\n\\nWhile the slingers on its back picks off the enemy with impunity, the elephant charges on, scattering foes in its path, crushing anyone too slow or foolish to not get out of its way. Even buildings are not safe from a charging elephant. And with its already tough hide supplemented by armour, this mobile fortress is all but impregnable. 	false
unit_description_historical_texts_text_3k_dlc06_unit_metal_nanzhong_champions	Meng Huo is a natural leader, a resourceful man of pride and honour who is not to be slighted. His fearlessness can lead to brazen acts, and these in turn to being captured by the enemy, though never, it seems, for long. \\n\\nHis best infantry do him proud, wielding axe or mace with consummate skill, while also showing strength in defence. 	false
unit_description_historical_texts_text_3k_dlc06_unit_metal_nanman_warriors_captain	The colourful and varied southern men who hunt and farm these lands have always lived here – they were well established even before the Shang founded their first kingdom. Though Nanman territory has been claimed by many rulers over the centuries, their warriors will only take up arms on their own terms. Neither sophisticated behaviour nor great skill are to be expected from these wild peoples, but they will fight with great heart, with axe or mace in hand.	false
unit_description_historical_texts_text_3k_main_unit_earth_jian_cavalry_captain	The role of sword cavalry is to hold the line against enemy attackers; their swordsmanship with the jian – known as the 'Gentleman of Weapons' – along with their leather armour and rattan shields, enables them to stand long after other defenders have fallen. \\n\\n Being mounted, they can race to relieve beleaguered allies and protect them against encroaching threats, but like all cavalry, spears and polearms will pierce their defences.	false
unit_description_historical_texts_text_3k_dlc06_unit_wood_nanzhong_spearmen	As one of the greatest war-leaders of the Nanman, Meng Huo understands the importance of spears in battle. \\n\\nProvided with sufficient armour to give them the confidence to enter the fray and a sturdy two-handed metal-tipped spear, these warriors will serve well in either defensive or offensive capacities. A well-braced line of spearman can even stand firm against a cavalry charge.	false
unit_description_historical_texts_text_3k_dlc05_unit_water_white_tiger_raiders	To the nobility, raiding is a nuisance, a thorn in their side. But to the raider, it is a source – perhaps the only source – of sustenance in a world that has forgotten them. To be a raider is to eschew tradition rules of engagement and fight by whatever means necessary to see victory. \\n\\n The raiders of the White Tiger move swiftly, with swiftness of the gale, striking hard in key locations before vanishing back to a safe distance.	false
unit_description_historical_texts_text_3k_dlc04_unit_water_poachers	The poacher knows the land intimately; years of hunting and tracking has given him an innate understanding of how to work with nature to seek, find and ultimately kill. \\n\\n As such, these warriors can move where others cannot, and faster besides. They do not carry particularly good spears or bows, for their ability comes from surprising foes as they would a wild boar, dealing swift and shocking damage and sowing chaos amongst enemy ranks before a large engagement.	false
unit_description_historical_texts_text_3k_main_unit_metal_black_mountain_marauders	By creeping behind enemy lines, Black Mountain Marauders can launch early surprise attacks on unsuspecting foes. The wounds dealt by the marauders' fu axes can be catastrophic, while their fearlessness ensures that they will stand fast even when their incursion has been discovered by the enemy. \\n\\n Once the element of surprise has been lost, the marauders are vulnerable to missiles, their tunics helping them to move quietly but providing little defence against arrows or spears.	false
unit_description_historical_texts_text_ep_unit_dao_swordguard	Although known as one of the four 'great weapons' of the realm, the dao languished in relative obscurity during the early centuries of the Han, with the double-edged jian sword far more widely employed. However, the dao has now all-but replaced the jian in standard armies. \\n\\n Most commonly a long, single-edged sword with a curve at the end, the dao is mostly used by soldiers to slash opponents, which is more efficient and expends less energy than skewering a foe with a jian.	false
unit_description_historical_texts_text_3k_main_unit_fire_mercenary_cavalry_captain	If a soldier fights for gold, rather than out of loyalty, then they are expected to serve with excellence and earn their pay. For the right price, these cavalry troops will arrive for battle armed with exceptional qiang spears and clad in fine leather armour. \\n\\n Hardened by years of fighting under many banners, they can still fight well in the blistering heat, and their mobility is especially useful for racing in and capturing key strategic points.	false
unit_description_historical_texts_text_3k_dlc05_unit_metal_zhanmajian_infantry	Like the dark before the dawn, battle is a dark affair that – hopefully – leads to a brighter tomorrow. The zhanmadao, known otherwise as the 'horse-chopping sabre', is a dark weapon for the darkest of those times. \\n\\n The cavalry charge is fearsome, and so too must its countermeasure be equally fearsome. With a long, broad blade, the two-handed zhanmadao is so powerful that with a strong enough strike, it can cleave straight through a steed's legs, bringing a charge to a brutal conclusion.	false
unit_description_historical_texts_text_3k_dlc07_unit_water_northern_mounted_archers	Those peoples less bound by the conventions and strictures of the Han have always formed less orthodox fighting forces. Often more mobile and suited to a nomadic lifestyle, these units are nevertheless co-opted by Cao Cao as he continues his conquest of the north. \\n\\n Mounted archers are tactically useful, able to fire on enemies from a distance, then ride away before the inevitable counter-attack. The ability to consistently harass from afar is of great use to any would-be conqueror.	false
unit_description_historical_texts_text_3k_main_unit_fire_raider_cavalry	Speed and mobility are more important to these mounted troops than armour, and at full gallop they have enough power to shock and stagger lightly-armoured enemies, softening them up for heavier allies. \\n\\n The raiders’ strength is not in prolonged, close skirmishes, but their flexibility to move quickly across the battlefield and the initial impact of their spear-led charges. \\n\\n This flexibility makes them useful for chasing down enemies attempting to flee the battlefield, quickly adding to the tally of enemy casualties.	false
unit_description_historical_texts_text_3k_dlc04_unit_wood_imperial_gate_guards	In defence of the emperor, these soldiers will cut back any enemy and, if need be, give their very lives. In these dark days, where the Han are embattled on many fronts, the Imperial Gate Guards act as an imposing reminder that the emperor's word is still law. \\n\\n Clothed in metal armour and bearing heavy polearms, any marauder, barbarian or rebel will soon find a swift end before their righteous, stalwart line.	false
unit_description_historical_texts_text_3k_dlc05_unit_wood_yue_tribesmen	Mighty, gnarled monoliths, the imposing peaks of China's south stand like sentinels against the unrelenting waters beyond. Amongst these hills and peaks, the Yue tribes eke out their continued existence; brought low from the once-proud past, they stand now against the threat of Han invasion from the north. \\n\\n Yet, united behind one who purports to fight for their ideals, the Yue are able to summon themselves into something resembling their own strength – their legacy demands it! 	false
unit_description_historical_texts_text_ep_unit_qi_guardsmen	Guardsmen hold the line; that is their sole duty. Armed with a ji polearm - a halberd, or 'dagger axe' - they are able to both thrust and stab defensively, but also cleave and grab their enemies thanks to the lunged hook on the side of the spear's blade. \\n\\n Guardsmen are defensible, but relatively mobile, lacking the heavy armour of some other spearmen. All the same, in the name of Sima Jiong, they stand ready to hold back the onslaught of any foe.	false
unit_description_historical_texts_text_3k_main_unit_metal_axe_band	A group of screaming enemy soldiers charging towards you is unnerving, but when those soldiers are holding axes, it becomes terrifying. Though the heavy fu axe was once used as a tool, it has been repurposed for the battlefield - now its chief purpose is to split foes' skulls. \\n\\n These warriors are considered shock-troops because of their powerful charge, which staggers enemies and leaves them vulnerable; the warriors swing their axes in one hand while the other holds a shield to parry retaliatory blows.	false
unit_description_historical_texts_text_3k_dlc04_unit_water_imperial_palace_crossbowmen	All along the ramparts of the imperial palaces and the bastions of the capital, the crossbowmen of the palace stand ready to repel all invaders with thundering bolts and an unending zeal. \\n\\n The crossbow can be fired and reloaded with relative alacrity and accuracy, even by the relatively unskilled, compared to the training and power required to use a standard bow. The highly-trained imperial soldiery, then, truly are dealers in death.	false
unit_description_historical_texts_text_3k_dlc04_unit_water_qiang_archers	The bow is a most elegant and versatile weapon, used for centuries beyond counting for survival; first, hunting and then, later, when man fought man, warfare. Those who continue to practice these old ways - such as the tribes of the Qiang - continue their daily practice and as such are now unparalleled archers. \\n\\n This proficiency with the bow is what makes them desirable as irregular warriors in any army, as they can bring an asymmetrical element to forces otherwise mired by predictable formations and military styles.	false
unit_description_historical_texts_text_3k_dlc06_unit_wood_sanjiang_poison_spears	Though not renowned as a weapon of cunning, in skilled hands the spear can be wielded silently to surprise the enemy, striking from the shadows. \\n\\nAnd if the foe spots an odd glistening on the point of the weapon before a two-handed thrust from a Sanjiang stalwart embeds it in their innards, they may, if they have time, feel an additional level of fear; and rightly so, for these weapons are tipped with poison. 	false
unit_description_historical_texts_text_3k_ytr_unit_water_watchmen_of_the_peace	Enter a battle ready for anything and you are far more likely to survive it. These watchmen once guarded cities belonging to tyrannical warlords, but have now joined the Yellow Turbans to guard China’s spirit instead. \\n\\n Their military training means they are as skilled with the crossbow as their sabres, and well equipped with good armour and helmets. This combined ability to engage in long-range and close combat, whether defensively or offensively, makes them a very flexible – and very valuable – unit on the field.	false
unit_description_historical_texts_text_ep_unit_xianbei_horse_archers	The Xianbei are a nomadic people who spent much of their history in thrall to more powerful nomads, such as the Xiongnu. They raided imperial lands as the Han dynasty weakened, but were eventually curtailed by the cunning Cao Cao. \\n\\n Well-trained in the versatility and speed of cavalry strikes, these horse archers are a tactical boon to any commander, who can use them to constantly harass enemies with arrow fire, without much fear of repercussion.	false
unit_description_historical_texts_text_3k_dlc06_unit_metal_ravine_warriors	King Mulu may be a master of beasts, but he does not neglect the infantry in his army. \\n\\nIn the wake of his elephants come the Ravine Warriors, enthusiastic and competent fighters of the southern mountains. \\n\\n With a pair of axes or maces apiece, they will happily finish off any remaining foes.	false
unit_description_historical_texts_text_3k_ytr_unit_wood_yellow_turban_spearmen	These spearmen were once bandits who preyed on trade routes to survive, so have experience in using spears to defend against mounted guardsmen. \\n\\n The Great Cause needs to muster all the bodies it can to fight the blight of tyranny, and any hypocrisy questioning a volunteer’s past or morality only reduces the hands that can be raised. \\n\\n The former bandits now take up arms against the real enemy of the people to fight for a greater prize than mere loot.	false
unit_description_historical_texts_text_3k_dlc07_unit_wood_quingzhou_halberds	These halberds, and the warriors they belong to, have fought many sides in these wars; now, they fight for yet another. Cao Cao's merciful bargain drew the remnant rebels into his fold, and so he consumed their lost purpose with his own. \\n\\n They fight now for his ambition, though without his same zeal and fervour: they will fight, and they will break. But every so often their fire will once more burst forth, and consume all before them in the inferno.	false
unit_description_historical_texts_text_3k_ytr_unit_water_horseback_huntsmen	The homemade fur tunics, caps and leather armour of these huntsmen are the proof that they are used to tracking and finding prey and chasing it down on horseback if it tries to flee. \\n\\n Now they target enemy soldiers, but the technique is much the same; single out a kill, aim and let the arrow fly, then run them to ground. \\n\\n However, these mounted huntsmen are not used to their game fighting back, and if they are forced to fight the enemy in close sword combat, they will be at a disadvantage.	false
unit_description_historical_texts_text_3k_ytr_unit_metal_yellow_turban_warriors	Corrupt warlords label them outlaws, but there is a greater justice than man’s law and the sympathies of these bandits lie with China’s poor. \\n\\n Long years evading and skirmishing with the authorities has made warriors of them, and they march into battle clad in light leather armour, shield in one hand and sabre in the other, to strike at the enemy’s flanks. \\n\\n Many have been forced into banditry from the greed of landlords, but with the approach of the Yellow Sky, they see a chance for a better future.	false
unit_description_historical_texts_text_3k_dlc04_unit_water_the_land_s_chosen	It is a central tenet of Taoism that the land must be revered and nurtured; it, in turn, will return to us its bounties. Those chosen warriors who receive of nature's boons must use its gifts to pursue those who have contributed to the corruption and destruction plaguing the land. \\n\\n From the boughs of the trees, arrows and bows are fashioned and handled by warriors who wield them with greater expertise than most of their contemporaries.	false
unit_description_historical_texts_text_3k_ytr_unit_water_men_of_the_forest	Greedy and exploitative landowners have forced many to resort to poaching their estates for survival, but the Yellow Turbans now give these reluctant outlaws a chance to strike back. \\n\\n In leather armour fashioned from the skins of their kills, the Men of the Forest employ the very same techniques used when hunting game to conceal themselves on the battlefield, to better ambush unsuspecting enemies by charging them with axes, or pick them off with the deadly accuracy of their bows.	false
unit_description_historical_texts_text_ep_unit_xiongnu_cataphracts	The Xiongnu are a nomadic people hailing from north of China. They were nominally tributaries to the previous dynasty, yet remained unruly and insolent to the Han emperors, until Cao Cao eventually tamed their tempestuous tempers and deployed them in his own armies. \\n\\n Cataphracts, heavily-armoured horses known for their devastating charge, are even more fearsome when deployed by the Xiongnu, who live their lives in the saddle and understand cavalry warfare better than any others!	false
unit_description_historical_texts_text_3k_main_unit_wood_peasant_band	These peasants have heard the call of war, abandoning their fields and crops for the battlefield and farming tools for long qiang spears. Their role on the battlefield is the thankless but vital one of remaining in line with their spears braced at an angle to fight off charges from mounted troops. \\n\\n Their spears are strong enough to pierce the armour of heavy cavalry, but being considered expendable, these peasants lack armour themselves and will be cut down quickly in close combat.	false
unit_description_historical_texts_text_3k_ytr_unit_earth_virtuous_noblemen	The Yellow Turban rebellion challenges the corruption that poisons China and has made many question old loyalties. \\n\\n These noblemen have renounced their former warlords to seek justice and redemption. Their previous life of privilege has trained and equipped them well, and they ride into battle clad in ornate armour and helmets upon impressive mounts of the finest stock. \\n\\n With axes ready and raised shields, the impact of their charge is merely a way to break the enemy’s lines for deadly close combat.	false
unit_description_historical_texts_text_3k_main_unit_fire_lance_cavalry_captain	These cavalry target not only the bodies of their enemies, but their morale as well. Crouched low on their mounts, ji polearms clutched tightly under their arms, they charge hard and fast into enemies with the aim of striking fear and forcing them to rout from the battlefield. \\n\\n Once a charge is completed, they can ride out of range of retaliation and prepare for their next assault. Their iron armour provides some protection in close combat, but they remain vulnerable in sustained encounters and to missile attack.	false
unit_description_historical_texts_text_3k_ytr_unit_metal_arm_of_the_supreme_peace	The Arm of the Supreme Peace consists of those whose appetite for food is matched only by their need to prove their might. \\n\\n There are only so many local strongman competitions before a greater glory is desired, and a rebellion never worries about a lack of training in its volunteers. \\n\\n The men are equipped with the largest armour that can be sourced and given heavy maces that few others could carry, let alone wield – swung by these men, the mace can fell several foes in one punishing arc.	false
unit_description_historical_texts_text_ep_unit_xiongnu_cavalry	The Xiongnu are a nomadic people hailing from north of China. They were nominally tributaries to the previous dynasty, yet remained unruly and insolent to the Han emperors, until Cao Cao eventually tamed their tempestuous tempers and deployed them in his own armies. \\n\\n The Xiongnu live their lives in the saddle, and as such their cavalry is always prepared. It is said that cavalry is the foundation of military power; if so, the Xiongnu are truly mighty indeed!	false
unit_description_historical_texts_text_3k_dlc06_unit_water_juggernaut	The manifold devices of war can be as ingenious as the repeating crossbow or as stealthy as the poisoned blowpipe.\\n\\nSome war machines, however, are neither sophisticated nor subtle. The juggernaut may be slow-moving and hard to manoeuvre, and its operation may require a mixture of knowledge, dexterity and good fortune, but those enemies caught in the line of fire when the juggernaut roars will be destroyed.   	false
unit_description_historical_texts_text_3k_dlc05_unit_metal_camp_crushers	Sun Tzu said that one should always give an enemy room to escape, so that they do not fight with the fervour of the doomed. Yet for Gao Shun's elite force, the Camp Crushers, being entirely surrounded is nothing but another dimension to slaughter. \\n\\n Renowned for their abilitiy to smash through enemy formations, the Camp Crushers excel even when surrounded. The bodies will pile high, but the Camp Crushers will still emerge from the pile victorious. 	false
unit_description_historical_texts_text_3k_ytr_unit_metal_white_wave_veterans	Named after the White Wave Valley they hail from, these rebels have long resisted the corrupt ruling classes by employing guerrilla tactics. This fighting style forgoes any gentlemanly rules of engagement if it means beating the enemy. \\n\\n Years of fighting larger numbers have made them fleet of foot, meaning they can rush to support beleaguered allies or charge quickly into enemy lines to destabilise them. Once engaged, these warriors' skill with sword and shield enables them to hold their own in close combat.	false
unit_description_historical_texts_text_3k_dlc06_unit_metal_might_of_the_valley	Unconcerned with rough terrain, armoured and strong in defence yet agile and fast, the Might of the Valley are Wuling's greatest warriors. \\n\\nThey wield their massive axes with effortless skill, and when called upon to charge the enemy, they are a sight to strike fear into the heart of any warrior. Should battle go against them, however, they still have more to give, and will fight on to the last without giving in.	false
unit_description_historical_texts_text_3k_main_unit_water_white_horse_fellows	Only the most exceptional troops are given the honour of riding the purest of white horses; if the mounts' appearance is not enough to strike fear into their targets’ superstitious hearts, then the riders’ accuracy with their long siyah bows will surely intimidate. \\n\\n The horses are trained to ignore the din of battle, so that their riders can harass enemies with arrows or attack with zhibeidao swords, without fear that their horses will panic and bolt.	false
unit_description_historical_texts_text_3k_dlc04_unit_water_territorial_archer	Most peasants are not taught the ways of war, rather they are handed the implements of battle and pointed in the direction of the enemy. It is thus fortunate that a bow, although difficult to master, is easy enough to use on a fundamental level. \\n\\n Although these territorial warriors may want for skill, they have a surfeit of zeal - they may draw a clumsy bowstring, but they fire, again and again, with the fiery determination of one defending his home and his life.	false
unit_description_historical_texts_text_3k_dlc06_unit_wood_javelin_spearmen	The versatility of the spear makes it a vital asset to any army, despite its relative simplicity. The same weapon can be used to throw, defend or attack in melee.  \\n\\nEven the bulkier two-handed spear can be thrown like a javelin, although the number of such weapons an individual warrior can carry is somewhat limited.\\n\\nAfter their initial throw, these spearmen stand ready to lead a charge, or withstand one.	false
unit_description_historical_texts_text_3k_dlc06_unit_wood_wolf_pack	Some call the Nanman barbarians, and their ability to work with wild animals may be held up as testament to that. But man and wolf have a long history, hunting as partners, seeking prey together. \\n\\n That same pack mentality embodies these warriors who, although without their trusted lupine companions, fight their foes with that same ferocity, gorging on the hunt and despatching the enemy with axe, mace or – sometimes, in the heat of the moment - teeth!	false
unit_description_historical_texts_text_3k_ytr_unit_wood_militia_of_virtue	These martial arts students have mastered the use of the gun staff, known as the ‘grandfather of weapons’. \\n\\n Effortless action means to act with the flow of nature rather than trying to impose an action against it, demonstrated by the graceful and organic parries of the staff as it mirrors the movement of the body. \\n\\n Each action flows to the next, allowing them to swiftly switch between defence and attack and utilise the minimum amount of energy, so they that they never tire in battle.	false
unit_description_historical_texts_text_3k_dlc04_unit_earth_messengers_of_heaven	The warriors of the Yellow Turban cause have deep roots drawn from all corners of the land. Their styles, therefore, may be unconventional, but their determination and belief is beyond doubt. \\n\\n Those entrusted with delivering the message of the cause ride to battle with a sword in each hand and no armour. This might be a display that some would call crazed, but to see the whirlwind of destruction they wreak upon the battlefield, none can help but be impressed and intimidated.	false
unit_description_historical_texts_text_3k_main_unit_earth_jian_swordguard_cavalry	The role of sword cavalry is to hold the line against enemy attackers; their swordsmanship with the jian – known as the 'Gentleman of Weapons' – along with their leather armour and rattan shields, enables them to stand long after other defenders have fallen. \\n\\n Being mounted, they can race to relieve beleaguered allies and protect them against encroaching threats, but like all cavalry, spears and polearms will pierce their defences.	false
unit_description_historical_texts_text_ep_unit_qi_crossbowmen	Whilst bowmen require training and physical prowess, crossbowmen need only load, point and shoot - the mechanism of the weapon does the rest. The bolt punches faster and harder than a bow, and can be used effectively by peasants and noblemen alike, making the crossbow truly deadly in anyone's hands. \\n\\n Sima Jiong's crossbowmen are an impressive, resplendently-armoured sight on the battlefield, and the prowess they display with their weapons gives pause to even the most armoured of attackers.	false
unit_description_historical_texts_text_3k_dlc07_unit_wood_northern_veteran_spears	To serve as a spearmen is to know more of a battle than any other; the veterans, therefore, must be paragons to those who serve alongside them, a standard to aspire to where others would falter. \\n\\n These spearmen have earned commendation and merit in the field against myriad northern invaders – better armed and armoured as befits their station, they are prepared to weather the storm of battle as it rolls across the field towards them.	false
unit_description_historical_texts_text_3k_main_unit_metal_fists_of_the_bandit_queen	Zheng Jiang has selected her most ferocious bandits to act as her ‘Fists of the Bandit Queen’; their role is to act as shock-troops, sneaking behind enemy lines to terrify foes with surprise attacks early in the battle. \\n\\n Each carries a heavy fu axe in each hand, and the wounds dealt by them can be catastrophic. Striking terror requires these troops to be without fear themselves, but also means they can tend to be undisciplined and difficult to control once their blood is hot with battle.	false
unit_description_historical_texts_text_3k_dlc05_unit_fire_bandit_raiders	As the monsoon rains strike down upon the land, the shock cavalry charge is relentless, persistent and devastating. Cavalry have formed the hammer blow of armies for centuries, and even bandit armies – irregular as they are – know their value. \\n\\n With spears thrust forward, the raiders bear down upon their foes, intent on skewering any in the line before them, and cutting a swathe through the enemy lines.	false
unit_description_historical_texts_text_3k_main_unit_water_defenders_of_earth	Only the very finest warriors are chosen for the honour of serving the emperor as frontline troops. Archers of exceptional talent who also show skill with the deadly jian sword are recommended to the emperor as Defenders of Earth. \\n\\n If they pass inspection, they are rewarded with uniquely-crafted jian swords and composite bows to fight on the frontline. Their arrows have small pots of flammable oil affixed to them; the fuses are lit, and the arrow loosed to rain down fire upon their enemies.	false
unit_description_historical_texts_text_3k_main_unit_water_black_mountain_hunters	When firing at enemies from a distance, these hunters’ arrows may fall short of their targets, but their real strength lies in the ability to sneak up on unsuspecting prey to dispatch them at close range. \\n\\n Creeping deep into enemy territory to launch surprise attacks requires no small amount of courage, and these troops are fearless, thinking only of splitting skulls with their fu axes. \\n\\n However, that same bravery can make them undisciplined and susceptible to the occasional reckless action.	false

unit_description_historical_texts_text_3k_dlc07_unit_earth_northern_sabre_cavalry	The intention of the Han's northern army was to defend against tribal threats, and if possible to put them to rout. None are better suited to that task than the sabre cavalry. Although their thundering charge is a sight to behold, their true value comes from their endurance in melee. \\n\\n Once the dust has settled from a powerful charge, these horsemen will remain, deflecting blows with reinforced armour, and aiming to shatter morale with savage hacks, slicing through body and mind both.	false
unit_description_historical_texts_text_3k_dlc07_unit_wood_ye_vanguard_spearmen	Although there is wisdom in not overbearing soldiery with too many arms, these warriors prove their right to march with spear, crossbow and shield in hand. Certainly not a task for the untrained, these elite warriors take up formations behind their shields and patiently wait for the enemy. \\n\\n When faced with imminent melee, they unleash a devastating crossbow volley from between their shields before bracing their spears against the onslaught to come. 	false
unit_description_historical_texts_text_3k_main_unit_earth_qiang_raiders	The nomadic lifestyle of the Qiang tribespeople has honed their skills in cavalry warfare, forging them into an unstoppable force. \\n\\n The power of their cavalry charges is almost unmatched, and once the initial impact of the charge has scattered their foes, they start hacking and chopping at those still standing with expertly made zhibeidao swords. \\n\\n However, no matter how unrelenting they are in spirit, Qiang Raiders' only defences are rattan shields and leather armour, leaving them vulnerable in sustained close combat.	false
unit_description_historical_texts_text_3k_dlc06_unit_metal_followers_of_the_flame	Said to be descended from the god of fire, Lady Zhurong is a formidable general. Whilst others, such as Meng Huo, are great leaders, she shows as much courage and wisdom as they. \\n\\nHer followers are fiercely loyal, well trained, and devastating. Every swing of their great maces sends the enemy sprawling, but there is more – the head of each mace is aflame, and its crushing force is backed up with fire, splashing over the enemy, setting clothes and armour alight.	false
unit_description_historical_texts_text_3k_ytr_unit_metal_youxia	Many decry injustice, but it takes a unique temperament to travel the land to actively oppose it, and great skill to survive each encounter. Recognising a shared goal, the Youxia join the Yellow Turbans in the fight against tyranny. \\n\\n Their armour and expensive shields are scarred by many battles, testaments to their experience, and their precise swordsmanship demonstrates a discipline rare among those who have achieved some renown. It is this purity of intent that makes them so effective on the frontlines.	false
unit_description_historical_texts_text_3k_main_unit_water_archer_militia	Militia are recruited quickly, armed and mobilised in mass numbers, without spending much time on training before deployment. Any conscript who demonstrates some ability in archery is given a composite bow and enlisted as an archer. \\n\\n These archers are considered useful to increase numbers, but less skilful than seasoned soldiers, and so are given zhibeidao swords for protection rather than armour. \\n\\n These straight-bladed swords are cheap but easily mastered, making them the perfect weapon for militia troops.	false
unit_description_historical_texts_text_3k_main_unit_earth_yellow_dragons	Enemy infantry fall easily before the Yellow Dragons’ attacks; their fu axes rend flesh with the savagery of a dragon’s fangs, and retaliatory blows bounce off their shields as water from oil. \\n\\n The Yellow Dragons’ empathy and understanding of the land is such that it offers as little resistance to their movements as air, and they cross all terrain types effortlessly and quickly. \\n\\n With this combination of mobility and strength, the Yellow Dragons move quickly through the battle, dispatching the foes and allies of chaos.	false
unit_description_historical_texts_text_3k_dlc04_unit_metal_bringers_of_peace	If peace is the ideal future to be attained, the Yellow Turbans must be, paradoxically, prepared to fight for it. It is the soldiers who know and accept this truth who will fight the hardest for it. \\n\\n With dual axes, they create a maelstrom of violence when wading into battle. Those enemies fortunate enough not to be cleaved in two are sent sprawling before the might and unbreakable spirit of these Yellow Turban zealots. 	false
unit_description_historical_texts_text_3k_dlc05_unit_metal_yue_remnant_warriors	In ages past, the tribes of the south held together as one unified band, significant enough to be known as the state of Yue. With the advent of the Han, however, such places and titles are no longer fitting, as the Yue have fractured. \\n\\n The disparate remnants of the state are scattered across the vast southlands, clinging to their lineage. They refuse to relent, offering their strength to any who would help them retain their freedoms and their culture.	false
unit_description_historical_texts_text_3k_dlc07_unit_fire_northern_lancer_cavalry_captain	Heavily armoured and rigorously trained, these lancer cavalrymen are the keen blade that cuts through the heart of enemy formations. Commanded by an experienced captain, they are leaders on the field of battle, and the sight of their deadly charge is enough to fortify even the weariest spirit amongst their allies. \\n\\n In the absence of a great general, their peers may rest assured that the day will not be lost. It is clear that these men of the north stand ready to fight under the leadership of this brave lancer cavalry and their trusted captain.	false
unit_description_historical_texts_text_3k_dlc07_unit_wood_quingzhou_spears	Though the fire of the Noble Rebellion is all but spent in the land, the slimmest guttering embers still burn in the hearts of these warriors. Remnants of the last noble rebellion would be usually marked for death, yet Cao Cao offered them mercy for service. Although they welcome the blade's reprieve, they show little enthusiasm for their new fight. \\n\\n Scarcely armed, these fighters will break quickly – however, their long-dimmed fervour will sometimes burst forth, surprising all with their zeal and ferocity.	false
unit_description_historical_texts_text_3k_main_unit_water_crossbowmen	It takes years of training and immense upper strength to be able to draw back the bowstring to the nocking point. Firing a crossbow needs the user to be taught only how to load a bolt and point it. \\n\\n Unlike notching an arrow, however, a crossbow bolt can be loaded easily and held until the user is ready to fire. \\n\\n Despite its ease of use, the draw-weight increases the bolt's speed and power when released, meaning that less-skilled troops can be armed but still prove deadly on the battlefield.	false
unit_description_historical_texts_text_3k_dlc04_unit_metal_chosen_of_the_eight_immortals	Those warriors who seek to inherit the gift of the Eight Immortals must show extreme endurance and martial skill, as well as great dedication to mediation and the quest for enlightenment. \\n\\n  They are armed with two short ji polearms and leather armour, ensuring they are both fast and powerful on the battlefield. To be the chosen of the Eight Immortals is to inhabit their power and their spirit both.	false
unit_description_historical_texts_text_3k_dlc07_unit_metal_quingzhou_assault_infantry	Whatever cause these warriors used to fight for is gone; now they have a new purpose, if not the same zeal. It was Cao Cao that saved these former rebels from traitors' deaths, and though they swear their arms to a new cause, their hearts do not follow. \\n\\n Better armed and armoured than their other erstwhile rebel comrades, they suffer the same lack of morale for the cause. Yet on occasion, they will show a glimpse of their former fury, and be overtaken by a zealous warrior's rage!	false
unit_description_historical_texts_text_3k_main_unit_wood_heavy_spear_guards	The momentum of a cavalry charge is like waves crashing onto rocks to these heavily-armoured troops. Clad in iron armour, and equipped with a tower shield, they can form formidable defensive lines against the enemy. \\n\\n Their rectangular shield is tall enough to cover a soldier’s crouching body, and the small gaps in the formation enable them to thrust spears through at the enemy while remaining protected.	false
unit_description_historical_texts_text_3k_dlc07_unit_metal_northern_sabre_infantry_captain	As an instrument of war, there are few threats more deadly than the swift and brutal cut of a sabre. Yet the men who bear them may prove more deadly still. Resolutely marching into the thick of battle to the rallying cries of their captain, these heavily armoured, expert infantrymen carve through the ranks of their opponents with a terrifying zeal. \\n\\n Should the northern tribes seek to cross the border in pursuit of war, this elite sabre infantry will make certain they find naught but the bitter taste of defeat.	false
unit_description_historical_texts_text_3k_dlc06_unit_water_fire_archers	Though the crossbow has many advantages, the traditional bow is a weapon of grace and power with a venerable history. Archery was listed as one of the Six Noble Arts, and has been practised by emperors and sages. A well-made bow in skilled hands is also a devastating weapon on the battlefield. \\n\\nTo increase the archer's effectiveness by firing flaming arrows might almost seem a step too far, were it not so effective. 	false
unit_description_historical_texts_text_3k_main_unit_fire_heavy_xiliang_cavalry	The thrust of a spear is deadly enough; when it is in the hands of the cavalry and powered by the momentum of a horse in full gallop, it is almost unstoppable. The qiang is a one-handed spear known as the 'King of Weapons', with a scarlet tassel of horse-hair attached below the blade, denoting its elite status. \\n\\n The tassel both prevents the blood of its targets from making the shaft slippery and obscures the blade when wielded, making it harder to block and evade when thrust.	false
unit_description_historical_texts_text_3k_main_unit_wood_protectors_of_heaven	The Protectors of Heaven are soldiers personally selected by the emperor for their proven excellence and loyalty in battle. It is their loyalty and commitment to the great cause that ensures they never tire in battle, even when leading furious charges from the frontlines. \\n\\n To display and complement their status as the head of an army to enemies and allies alike, they wear magnificent armour and wield gou lian dao polearms, both items commissioned exclusively by the emperor!	false
unit_description_historical_texts_text_3k_dlc07_unit_wood_northern_veteran_ji_infantry	Whatever exceptional training the ji infantry have – and it is exceptional – is honed to a sharpened point in these veterans. As part of the Han's northern army, they were trained to resist the savage, unorthodox warriors beyond the northern borders. \\n\\n As the soldiers who have survived such onslaughts, their skills are beyond doubt, to say nothing of the additional armour they have earned along the way.	false
unit_description_historical_texts_text_3k_dlc04_unit_water_imperial_palace_cavalry	The imperial palaces at Luoyang are the nexus of power for the Han dynasty, from which all authority flows outward across the realm. It is just, therefore, that the capital - and the palaces - are defended by the very best. \\n\\n The Imperial Palace Cavalry ride out armed with crossbows as well as sabres. This allows them to soften up enemies before a charge or ride at range whilst peppering the enemy with fire, because in defence of the dynasty, every strategy must be employed.	false
unit_description_historical_texts_text_3k_main_unit_wood_spear_warriors	Spears are an effective defence against enemy cavalry, but can also be used offensively as well. \\n\\n These infantry troops grip their qiang spears in both hands and put their weight behind the weapon to pierce armour and drive it through to the enemy inside. \\n\\n Outfitted in partial iron armour, they are somewhat protected against enemy assaults, meaning they can concentrate on defeating their quarry.	false
unit_description_historical_texts_text_ep_unit_mounted_crossbows	Much like their mounted archer counterparts, mounted crossbowmen are valued for their manoeuvrability on the battlefield. A contingent of warriors able to fire from range then swiftly retreat from any counter-attack is a useful tool to any commander. The crossbow has a particular benefit over the standard bow, however, in that it is far easier to use. This means that anyone able to ride a horse can be handed a crossbow and easily turned into a lethal force in battle.	false
unit_description_historical_texts_text_3k_ytr_unit_metal_yellow_sky_heralds	These heralds are eager to convert all who seek to deny the approach of the Yellow Sky. This utter certainty of the arrival of the Great Peace leads them to believe they are invulnerable, and there is some truth in it. \\n\\n Beneath their yellow robes and Taoist charms, they are well-protected by light armour, trained to parry blows with clubs, impossible to rout, and their charges shake the hardiest of enemies. However, their devotion can easily tip into frenzied fanaticism, sending them on an uncontrollable rampage.	false
unit_description_historical_texts_text_3k_main_unit_metal_mercenary_infantry	Victory in battle is decided not only on the strength and skills of soldiers, but on strategic control of the field. These mercenaries fight for gold, not out of loyalty, so when ordered to capture a key strategic point they put all efforts towards it or risk not getting paid. \\n\\n Offering their services to the highest bidder, their travels have acclimatised them to even the most punishing heat. Upon accepting a contract, they arrive fully equipped with fine leather armour, rattan shields and good quality fu axes.	false
unit_description_historical_texts_text_3k_dlc05_unit_earth_bandit_marauders	Whereas some cavalry bring a primal, instantly shattering force to the battlefield, other mounted warriors are suited to the slower burn, embroiling themselves in the melee and staying to continue inflicting casualties. \\n\\n These marauders carry dual axes into battle so, whilst they get less power on the charge, their destructive capability increases dramatically once they begin hacking away at foes.	false
unit_description_historical_texts_text_3k_dlc04_unit_wood_spearmen_gang	The beauty of the polearm is that it is a fundamentally simple weapon - anyone can be handed one and immediately understand how it works and where it should be pointed. This is particularly useful for the Yellow Turbans, whose troops largely lack military experience and training. \\n\\n Although unlikely to last long against hardened soldiery, a swelling gang of warriors armed with spears and an abundance of zeal will nevertheless charge headlong into battle. When one becomes one hundred, even the most elite warriors will soon be overwhelmed.	false
unit_description_historical_texts_text_3k_dlc04_unit_earth_mounted_sabre_defectors	What is considered a loss for the Han is inevitably a gain for the Yellow Turbans. So it is with territory, so it is with wealth, and so it is with troops. And who could blame the warrior, having heard of the promise of the Yellow Sky, for turning his back on the corruption of the Han and pledging his sword to another. \\n\\n With dao in hand, these cavalrymen ride now to secure a better future, shattering the enemy's lines as they shatter the Azure Sky itself!	false
unit_description_historical_texts_text_3k_dlc06_unit_water_tiger_slingers	The tiger warriors of Lady Zhurong are a sight to chill the hearts of all who face them. To fight with a tiger at your side is to enter the realm of legend, and the enemy would be wise to turn tail and flee. \\n\\nShould any foe find the strength to stand their ground, they must still face the handlers who control the great beasts, and who are highly skilled with their slings.	false
unit_description_historical_texts_text_3k_main_unit_wood_imperial_defenders	The momentum of a cavalry charge is like waves crashing onto rocks to these heavily-armoured troops. Clad in iron armour, and equipped with a tower shield, these warriors can form formidable defensive lines against the enemy. \\n\\n The rectangular shield is tall enough to cover a soldier’s crouching body, and the small gaps in the formation enables them to poke and thrust spears through at the enemy while remaining protected.	false
unit_description_historical_texts_text_3k_main_unit_water_white_horse_raiders	Only the most exceptional troops are given the honour of riding the purest of white horses; if the mounts' appearance are not enough to strike fear into their targets’ superstitious hearts, then the riders’ accuracy with their long siyah bows will surely intimidate. \\n\\n The horses are trained to ignore the din of battle, so their riders can harass enemies with arrows or attack with zhibeidao swords, without fear their horses will panic and bolt.	false
unit_description_historical_texts_text_3k_dlc04_unit_wood_ascetics_of_the_way	The zeal that radiates from some believers in the Yellow Turban cause is so potent as to be infectious to those around them, advancing the cause both in daily life and on the battlefield. \\n\\n Equipped simply with wooden staffs, these warriors nevertheless excel at holding their own whilst continually chanting encouragement to nearby comrades. Their weak armour, however, makes them susceptible to arrow fire. Yet whilst their bodies are transient, their souls and beliefs are always far beyond harm.	false
unit_description_historical_texts_text_3k_dlc06_unit_wood_nanman_spearmen	The spear is a simple weapon, and for the poorest fighters it may be little more than a sturdy bamboo cane honed to a point.  \\n\\nA spear keeps the enemy at arm's length, however, and can be used both to attack and defend. In the hands of big-hearted men who will do whatever it takes to defend what is theirs, spears can still take their toll in battle.	false
unit_description_historical_texts_text_3k_main_unit_fire_jade_dragons	These riders are as fearsome as the great beasts they take their name from. Their role is to take on the enemy directly, thrusting their two-handed qiang spears while mounted. \\n\\n Their horses are conditioned to ignore the din of battle, and have such high stamina that they never tire from fatigue, making them excellent for charging, moving out of range and then striking again.	false
unit_description_historical_texts_text_3k_dlc06_unit_metal_axe_throwers	These warriors choose skill and the effective strike from a distance over the comforting but cumbersome weight of heavy armour and weapons. \\n\\nTheir armour is light, backed up with a shield; just enough to let them get into range without fear of being cut down. Each solider carries but a few of their well-crafted throwing axes, but they have the throwing ability to make sure every shot counts. 	false
