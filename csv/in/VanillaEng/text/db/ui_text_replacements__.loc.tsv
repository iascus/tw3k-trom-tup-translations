ui_text_replacements_localised_text_3k_main_text_replacement_tech_fire_tier3_barded_mounts_long_description_key	When the horse became a more reliable tool of warfare, the next question inevitably became "how can they be made even more deadly?" The answer came in the form of 'barding' - armour for horses. \\n\\n This armour has the double benefit of protecting steeds whilst also increasing their mass and, accordingly, striking power. This increase in weight gives them more raw strength to slam into enemy ranks.	false

Whilst collections of texts are traditionally reserved for the imperial government or studious scholars, it is only right that the Yellow Turbans too have a repository of their sacred texts. \\n\\n The Books of Great Peace, the legendary tomes from which the Zhang brothers birthed the rebellion, are in fact ideologies spread across many different scriptures.
