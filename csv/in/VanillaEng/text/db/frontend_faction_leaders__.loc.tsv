A well-respected and high-ranking academic in the imperial capital, Luoyang, Liu Biao was vocal and outspoken in his criticisms of the corruption affecting the empire. The eunuchs, displeased by his defamations, found ways to strip him of his titles and all-but exile him. \\n\\n Liu Biao has now found himself far from the capital, a fervent loyalty for the Han and a burning hatred of the eunuchs still beating in his breast...	false

Descended from power and prestige, Yuan Shao was chosen – because of his reputation and wealth – to lead the coalition against Dong Zhuo's tyrannical reign.

To his north, east and south lie the Han, a persistent thorn in the side of those who would call themselves independent. Yet Shamoke must appease this unstable empire, lest he invite their wrath. At the same time, however, he is respected by the tribes of the south, and so cannot concede too much, or risk shattering the fragile ground beneath his feet.	false
