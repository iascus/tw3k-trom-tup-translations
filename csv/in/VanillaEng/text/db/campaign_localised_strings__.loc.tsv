campaign_localised_strings_string_3k_main_tutorial_mode_diplomacy_general_description	[[b]]Diplomacy[[/b]] is about forging alliances and isolating enemies. Negotiating preferable deals for goods, land, or trade is only one part of diplomacy. The diplomatic landscape – the [[b]]attitude[[/b]] of factions to each other – is vital, so be sure to inspect these relationships well in order to select potential friends or war targets.\\n\\nDiplomacy has two basic functions: \\nChoose [[b]]'Negotiate'[[/b]] if you want to engage in detailed dialogue with another faction to propose [[b]]deals[[/b]] or review existing ones.\\n\\n[[b]]'Quick Deal'[[/b]], on the other hand, allows you to pick a diplomatic deal first, then investigate who would be willing to sign it with you.\\n\\nEnsure that you exploit all your [[b]]trade agreements[[/b]] slots, but keep in mind that they are limited, so try to find only the most valuable trade partners. The income gained is determined by the total GDP of your faction, your trade partner, and the relative [[b]]trade influence[[/b]] of the two factions.	false

campaign_localised_strings_string_dlc06_tutorial_mode_fealty	Each Nanman faction carries a Fealty – a unique group of bonuses that constitute the essence of the faction.

By collecting them, Nanman factions will progress towards the unification of the tribes and thus ultimately becoming leader of them all. \\n\\n The Fealty panel displays the state of each Fealty and, if discovered, to whom they belong. \\n\\n When a tribe is defeated, vassalised or an alliance is formed, all Fealties that they own will be shared. In the event of a tribe being defeated by a non-Nanman culture, you can gain the Fealty from their last settlement.

campaign_localised_strings_string_dlc06_tutorial_mode_zhurong_wild_fire	Due to her alleged descent from the fire-god, Lady Zhurong is capable of temporarily imbuing herself with the god's fury – this is known as Wild Fire. When Wild Fire is active, and depending on the season in which it was activated, Zhurong gains extremely powerful buffs and is all-but unstoppable in battle. The different per-season effects can be seen when choosing to activate Wild Fire. When the effect wears out, however, she becomes weak and vulnerable and must rest. \\n\\n Wild Fire is obtained through the accrual of Goddess of Fire' points – Zhurong's unique resource – which generate at the end of every turn. When the threshold is met, Wild Fire can be activated. The longer it continues, the greater your army's upkeep will be and the worse its replenishment will become. You can end Wild Fire prematurely whenever you wish by re-clicking the Active Wild Fire button. \\n\\n If you allow the Goddess of Fire pool to fill entirely, you will at first gain a bonus to satisfaction, but the longer you continue without activating Wild Fire, the more this satisfaction will decay.	false

campaign_localised_strings_string_3k_dlc07_tutorial_mode_imperial_intrigue_enemy_of_the_han_description	An [[b]]enemy of the Han[[/b]] is a faction who has been [[b]]exiled from[[/b]] the remnants of the [[b]]Han Empire[[/b]] by Emperor Xian. Any faction that is the [[b]]imperial protectorate can declare a faction[[/b]] an [[b]]enemy of the Han[[/b]] if they have [[b]]below half imperial favour[[/b]]. As the player, this will only happen to you if [[b]]your imperial favour[[/b]] becomes dangerously [[b]]low[[/b]]. If any faction has [[b]]no imperial favour left[[/b]], they will immediately be [[b]]declared an enemy of the Han[[/b]]. Being declared an [[b]]enemy of the Han[[/b]] will [[b]]decrease[[/b]] that faction’s [[b]]diplomatic standing[[/b]] with all Han Empire factions. [[b]]Some AI factions[[/b]] will place [[b]]more importance[[/b]] on a faction that has been declared an [[b]]enemy of the Han[[/b]], while [[b]]some will place less importance[[/b]] due to their ambivalence towards the emperor. As the player, your faction will be given a chance to quickly restore your imperial favour. Once [[b]]your imperial favour is too low[[/b]], you will receive a [[b]]mission[[/b]] that will require you to [[b]]improve it[[/b]]. If you [[b]]fail[[/b]] to complete this [[b]]mission[[/b]] in time, you will be declared an [[b]]enemy of the Han[[/b]].Once you have been [[b]]declared an enemy of the Han[[/b]], you will be given a [[b]]dilemma[[/b]] that will give you the [[b]]option[[/b]] of trying to [[b]]improve your imperial favour, increasing your diplomatic standing[[/b]] with nearby factions, or [[b]]breaking away from the Han[[/b]], where you will gain a short boost to unit recruitment and replenishment.[[b]]Any faction[[/b]] that has [[b]]more than half imperial favour[[/b]] will have their status as an [[b]]enemy of the Han removed[[/b]]. 	false
