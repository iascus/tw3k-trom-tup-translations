The warlord Cao Cao, having united northern China, looks now upon the southlands. Upon seizing Jing province, he begins amassing an armada with which he plans to invade the riverlands held by Sun Quan. The Sun court, bitterly divided on the issue of such a war, is silenced when Sun Quan, persuaded by the eminent strategist Zhuge Liang, decides that the chancellorâs relentless ambition must be opposed.\\n\\nCao Caoâs force is untested on the waves, so the newly-forged alliance plots to send a spy to convince him to chain his ships together at port, ostensibly to keep them stable, but in reality making them vulnerable to spreading fire. With the plot hatched, the alliance sets sail â with the fate of China itself hanging in the balanceâ¦	false

LÃ¼ Bu grows in power, threatening to combine his strength with Yuan Shao and overwhelm all opposition. Yet betrayal comes naturally to LÃ¼ Bu, and now â isolated by his would-be allies â that lack of trust may be his undoing. Cao Cao, fearful of this potential threat, and aware of LÃ¼ Bu's fickle loyalties, marches now against his final stronghold - Xiapi - to quell his strength before it becomes too great.\\n\\nAfter months of siege warfare, and with morale beginning to dwindle on both sides, Cao Cao now senses the time is right; here, along the seam where north meets south, behind the walls of Xiapi, LÃ¼ Bu stands alone against the approaching march of Cao Cao's might.	false
