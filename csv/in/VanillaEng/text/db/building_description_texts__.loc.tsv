building_description_texts_long_description_3k_main_building_long_description_fishing_fleet_wharf	The addition of a wharf to this province’s fishing village allows more fishing boats to dock, unload their haul for collection, and unmoor to head back to the water to continue fishing. \\n\\n The deposited fish are collected by dock workers, packed in salt and temporarily placed into small storage buildings until the day’s yield can be transported as one. \\n\\n This hastens the delivery of fish and allows the boatmen to spend more time on the water, resulting in a higher yield of fish and more income for the province.	false
building_description_texts_long_description_3k_dlc06_district_military_infrastructure_1	No matter how well-trained a warrior may be, send him into battle without a weapon and he will not last long. \\n\\nWhen the call comes, your soldiers need to know they can get hold of the weapons they need without delay, allowing them to form up and march into battle with all necessary speed. A central repository for such items is therefore the logical solution.	false
building_description_texts_long_description_3k_main_building_long_description_markets_landlords_farming_estates	Estates provide permanent homes for the local farming community, attracting people looking for regular work and increasing income and food for the province. \\n\\n This creates a miniature ecosystem, where the grain produce from the fields provides food and income for the local peasantry, who use it to pay rent, which in turn goes towards the upkeep of the farms. \\n\\n With this additional revenue, farming enterprises can be improved by purchasing better tools and hiring in more workers.	false
building_description_texts_long_description_3k_main_building_long_description_port_coastal_trading_post	Development of the jetty into a harbour trading post increases the flow of trade and commerce into the district. \\n\\n Customers, merchants and visitors can anchor and moor their boats or ships in the harbour, either to transport in goods to sell to merchants and purchase for themselves or for third-parties. \\n\\n Much trade comes from the East and South China Sea routes, from countries as far flung as Tianzhu and Daqir. The exotic goods of China are well received in these places, and in high demand.	false
building_description_texts_long_description_3k_main_building_long_description_equipment_military_forge	A military forge enables a blacksmith to improve the quality of the weapons they produce. Fuel is placed within the forge and lit, and then air is directed and blasted up through the fire to fan it into an intense, white-hot heat. \\n\\n Next, ore is heated over the forge until it reaches a high enough temperature to become pliable, so it can be gradually hammered into shape. This process improves the quality of all metalwork, and so between orders the forge can be made available to be commissioned for commercial items.	false
building_description_texts_long_description_3k_main_building_long_description_gov_support_winnowing_machine_workshop	Before grain can be used, excess chaff and pests such as weevils must be removed. This is done by winnowing using one of several simple methods, such as throwing the grain into the air and allowing gravity to filter out the lighter chaff, or simply sieving it by hand. \\n\\n However, a more efficient method is to use one of the new winnowing machines. The grain and chaff mixture is put into the machine, where a rotary fan blows away the chaff as the grains are sieved into the separator.	false
building_description_texts_long_description_3k_main_building_long_description_security_watchtower_garrison	Watchtowers extend the view over the district, so that enemy incursions are sighted as early as possible. \\n\\n Garrison conscripts man the watchtowers, surveying the land for the movement of bands of encroaching enemies. If such a threat is spotted, the guards signal along the line to the main force, and if needed, fend off attacks by harassing enemies with bows and spears. \\n\\n The watchtower is visible to all in the town, and its looming presence deters any dissidents from stirring up trouble under its watchful eye.	false
building_description_texts_long_description_3k_main_building_long_description_grain_agricultural_garrison_camp	In his wisdom, Cao Cao has instigated the tuntian system here, which is the building and staffing of a farm to grow food for armies within the county, whether they are passing through, or encamped here on a permanent basis. \\n\\n Without it, armies would have to rely on the existing food, effectively taking it from the mouths of the local population and risking rebellion. This allows armies to plot their campaigns without compromise, as they can be assured that food and shelter always await them.	false
building_description_texts_long_description_3k_main_building_long_description_city_level_village	Officials oversee the development of the commandery’s village and its satellite resources here while acting as the local authority for the population. \\n\\n Some have lived here long enough to have lent their hands to the building of the village and may never venture beyond its borders, but the village itself can change: the mightiest oaks are born of acorns, and every village has the potential to grow to be a sprawling metropolis.	false
building_description_texts_long_description_3k_dlc06_district_residential_logistics_4	As with any other great endeavour meant to serve the masses, organisation is key here. \\n\\nEvery new contribution to this great storehouse is recorded with care, from the smallest sack of dried beans to a cartload of rice. Stored in a substantial building which is dry and vermin free, these lasting supplies are then ready to be re-issued to locals, or sent to where they are needed most. 	false
building_description_texts_long_description_3k_resource_banditry_black_market_1	Whilst a government may claim to provide for its people, there will always be objects they deem unsuitable for some, and too extravagant for others. A network of undercover black markets seeks to fix these discrepancies. \\n\\n These clandestine stores offer items forbidden by conventional markets; tribes beyond the border, for instance, are able to procure iron weapons, forged by Han smiths, and transport them out of the empire's territory. Not without significant cost, of course...	false
building_description_texts_long_description_3k_ytr_long_description_district_market_inn_yellow_turban_5	A communal square, where all can meet outside of the working day, increases the public order. \\n\\n Though many already know each other from their working life – from the fields, military service or as merchants – sitting down and relaxing with someone while enjoying a jug of rice wine is a very different experience and may reveal new favourable facets to their personality. \\n\\n The income from the wine boosts the economy of the area, and if the square is warm and welcoming enough – and the prices remain reasonable – it will even draw income from visiting strangers.	false
building_description_texts_long_description_3k_main_building_long_description_district_market_marketplace	Officially, merchants are considered to be low people living off the profits of the labour and creations of others, lacking the cultivation of the ruling classes or the moral character of the peasants who work the land. \\n\\n However, despite heavy taxes and other punitive social prohibitions, merchants are increasingly beneficial to the welfare of China, and many become wealthy from trade. \\n\\n A marketplace where both nomadic and locally-registered merchants can ply their trade only benefits the economy, bringing goods to the local population as well as income from sales.	false
building_description_texts_long_description_ep_building_long_description_government_judiciary_2	An emperor can only act upon the information they are given, consulting myriad reports in order to best understand their realm. All reports from the provinces flow through the office of the secretariat, led by the Imperial Secretary, who has the power of censorship over all documents. \\n\\n The secretary works within the imperial palace, dispatching clerks to the provinces to do the government's business. In this way, the secretary ensures that they have eyes and ears in every corner of the land.	false
building_description_texts_long_description_3k_main_building_long_description_horses_tribal_herders	The tribespeople inhabiting the northern fringes are intimately familiar with the land, and can be employed to manage war horses. Herding horses across pastures to find good grazing ground is a necessary but time consuming, and a knowledge of the territory essential. \\n\\n Once the horses have been led to graze, the tribesmen watch to ensure none are lost or wander into dangerous areas when leading them back to camp. As an outgrowth of the grazing, the land is removed of the unwanted weeds that threaten to strangle it.	false
building_description_texts_long_description_3k_main_building_long_description_admin_yuan_directorate	A directorate oversees the officials and assistants serving on the administration of the city. \\n\\n Systems of management are reviewed to ensure that they are free of unnecessary obstructions, guidelines are documented as clearly as possible, and performance is monitored for instances of merit or incompetence. \\n\\n The daily business of administration is therefore easier to navigate and execute, enhancing the diplomatic standing of Yuan Shao, who understands that war cannot be fought without firm foundations.	false
building_description_texts_long_description_3k_main_building_long_description_harbour_trading_port_spice	The demand for spices is high, and becoming more and more popular with people as a way of increasing the complexity of their dishes. \\n\\n China produces and exports its own spices, but many are imported from Tianzhu as well, and a spice trading port can take advantage of the South and East China sea routes to increase commerce within a region. \\n\\n This lucrative trade partnership expands China’s standing in the eyes of the world and brings many new opportunities for commerce within and without.	false
building_description_texts_long_description_3k_dlc06_district_military_infrastructure_3	If an army is to be successful in war it requires more than warriors to fight and officers to lead them. As well as feeding, clothing and training your soldiers, they must be outfitted with the correct equipment for the job at hand. \\n\\nTo ensure this process is speedy and seamless, one or more dedicated administrators may need to take on the task of cataloguing, issuing and replacing the arms and armour being hoarded against troubled times.	false
building_description_texts_long_description_3k_main_building_long_description_tools_workshop	Tools are used to create other tools, and so on. A workshop provides the apparatus and space needed for manufacturing tools, with a focus on tools for farming. \\n\\n Ore smelted in the blast furnace is either cast in moulds or melted again in a cylindrical furnace called a cupola, after which the metal is shaped into small tools or components for larger tools. \\n\\n New tools, such as the ploughshare, ease the farmer’s labour considerably, increasing the amount of food they farm, and the revenue generated from it.	false
building_description_texts_long_description_3k_main_building_long_description_inn_tea_house_grand	The elegance and grandeur of a grand tea house symbolises the prestige of those who frequent within. \\n\\n When military or political entanglement threatens to overwhelm, the grand tea house acts as a temporary refuge. Tea is offered in respect to its customers, and that respect is expected to be returned through their manners and interactions with other patrons. \\n\\n There is much wisdom to be had through reasoned discourse with others, the leisurely drinking of the tea aids contemplation before returning to the wider world.	false
building_description_texts_long_description_3k_main_building_long_description_livestock_pastures	The healthier the animal, the higher the quality of goods produced from them, and for animals kept as livestock, a regular diet is required. \\n\\n The food produced from farmlands is primarily to feed the population and trade, so livestock are fed by being led to pastures instead. In grazing, these kept animals are closest to their natural lifestyle. \\n\\n These pastures are large expanses covered with various grasses, and the grazing of animals helps manage the land, by keeping weeds and other undesirable plants to a minimum.	false
building_description_texts_long_description_3k_main_building_long_description_decadence_zhong_secretariat_of_zhong	For efficient administration, it is vital to establish clear guidelines for officials to follow. A secretariat is trained in drafting documents, translating instructions and statutes into surprisingly-clear legalese. \\n\\n The Yuan family come from a long tradition of civil servants who have served with distinction under the Han dynasty. With their descendant’s blood coursing through their veins, the new Zhong dynasty’s decrees lower public order but safeguard organisational rules to increase the efficiency of military logistics.	false
building_description_texts_long_description_3k_ytr_long_description_district_military_yellow_turban_caches_5	The Yellow Turbans must use every means at their disposal to rid the land of the tyrannical and corrupt. Much of their strength is drawn from the very people they fight for, who provide support by keeping loot and military supplies gathered from enemy settlements ready for any friendly armies that march nearby. \\n\\n An encamped fort has these supplies and provides a place for Yellow Turban armies to organise an ambush at short notice if needed. In contrast to the support they give the Yellow Turbans, enemy soldiers entering the territory are harassed, causing them to suffer attrition.	false
building_description_texts_long_description_3k_dlc06_district_government_religion_3	Dedicating somewhere to the spiritual life, and letting the spirit fly free from this world of care, is a laudable action. \\n\\nHere the ancestors are honoured with offerings and prayers, incense sweetens the air and chants are raised by those who wish to feel the touch of the sacred. \\n\\nWhether built up from the ground using the principles of harmonious construction, or carved into the mountains themselves, such spaces are an asset to any community.	false
building_description_texts_long_description_3k_main_building_long_description_rural_healers_village_healer	A healer knowledgeable in the principles of the Tao Te Ching offers wisdom for the betterment of the people. \\n\\n The powerful have oppressed their subjects for too long, boasting of Mandates of Heaven while idling in palaces, indulging unseemly vices and luxuriating in fine silk robes. This is at the cost of the people they should be serving, who break their backs to prop up these hypocritical parasites. \\n\\n Emancipation can only be gained through enlightenment, and the people will be shown the light to restore balance.	false
building_description_texts_long_description_3k_main_building_long_description_security_mounted_foragers	Born into poverty, Ma Teng was forced to learn how to forage for food directly from the land. The Ma family’s talent for survival proves to be indispensable for their soldiers in the field. \\n\\n Familiarity with the land and understanding of which plants and berries are poisonous is encouraged, so that patrols can find sustenance for themselves or others should food supplies run low. \\n\\n This gives them a great advantage over their enemies, who must rely on only what supplies they can carry.	false
building_description_texts_long_description_3k_resource_long_description_tea_tea_garden	The art and ritual of tea drinking is to create the sublime out of the ordinary; in the action of drinking, one strives to finding harmonious solitude, if only for a moment. Legends speak of Emperor Shennong seeking tranquillity beneath a tree when its leaves drifted into his drink. \\n\\n Intrigued, the emperor was surprised to find the concoction rich in both flavour and harmony; his soul was warmed and, so it is said, the traditions of Chinese tea drinking were born.	false
building_description_texts_long_description_3k_main_building_long_description_admin_palace_commandery_directorate	A directorate is staffed by the finest administrators in the civil service. Each one has been promoted through the ranks for exemplary service in other administrations, and comes with numerous recommendations speaking to their honourable character and abilities. \\n\\n The administration of the capital must be run with peak efficiency to stand as an example to all of China; once the glorious promise of this empire is proven and understood by the people, peace and reunification will be closer than ever.	false
building_description_texts_long_description_3k_dlc06_district_military_conscription_3	As recruits gain experience, they become warriors, ready to take the place of those who are falling in battle every day throughout China. \\n\\nThey learn new combat skills beyond the basics, and at least as importantly, how to march and fight together as one, becoming part of a greater whole. \\n\\nThe most talented conscripts may be picked for advanced training in the more unusual weapons and disciplines. 	false
building_description_texts_long_description_3k_main_building_long_description_rural_healers_enlightened_scholar	An enlightened scholar helps quicken the arrival to illumination. \\n\\n The powerful guard knowledge with a fierce jealousy, perverting the text and using it to bind the people, while raising their own stature. \\n\\n The enlightened scholar uses knowledge to inform and elevate, sharing wisdom in service of the people. \\n\\n The wisest of scholars understands that complete enlightenment is always just beyond reach; there are always new perspectives to be learnt, and the quest for wisdom is an endless journey, not a prize to be won. 	false
building_description_texts_long_description_3k_main_building_long_description_decadence_zhong_county_office	The Yuan family has a long and proud history of serving the civil bureaucracy of the Han dynasty, and this talent for administration is used to solidify the foundations of their own vie for power. \\n\\n A high level of ability is demanded from their administrative clerks and officials, who execute their duties – whether raising a garrison or collecting taxes – with the efficiency for which the Yuan are traditionally renowned.	false
building_description_texts_long_description_3k_main_building_long_description_port_coastal_trading_jetty	A jetty extends the reach of the village’s pier. It stretches out over the shallows of the coast, over deeper waters, and has a greater space for incoming or outgoing boats used for trading. \\n\\n The boats moor at the jetty, and the goods are unloaded for purchase in nearby markets or by private buyers. The income for the district is greatly increased, and creates more opportunities for expansion in the future.	false
building_description_texts_long_description_3k_dlc06_city_7	A city is more than its buildings and people, more even than its wealth and status: it is a focus for all the lands around it. Farmers travel for days to reach here in the hopes of selling their produce at a good price. \\n\\nAdministrative commands issued from the city affect the lives of those throughout the region. And it is part of a wider network of influential settlements, its name often spoken beyond its immediate sphere of influence. 	false
building_description_texts_long_description_3k_main_building_long_description_inn_liu_biao_clerk_travel_lodge	Clerks are hired for their practical expertise in governmental matters, and indispensable because of their hands-on local knowledge. \\n\\n A good clerk will have journeyed to many settlements during their career, making inspections and reporting their findings back to their superiors. \\n\\n A travel lodge offers accommodation for those visiting or passing through to another destination; a place where they can rest, eat and compose their reports, and a place clerks can recommend to their colleagues.	false
building_description_texts_long_description_3k_dlc06_district_government_administration_1	While individual families living alone in the mountains may make plans and resolve problems between themselves, when people begin to live together in larger groups it becomes necessary to discuss anything that may affect more than one household, be it the supply of food or the threat of raiders. \\n\\nSetting a time and place for such discussions gives structure to the lives of those who live in the community.	false
building_description_texts_long_description_3k_ytr_long_description_district_market_inn_yellow_turban_3	Whether you are a peasant, soldier or official, when you step over the threshold of a leisure house, you are as equal as any other patron – all that matters is that you have enough coin to pay for refreshment. \\n\\n Tables are shared by merchants and peasants alike, sparking conversations that could not happen anywhere else and providing perspective and insight into other people’s lives. \\n\\n With knowledge comes understanding and empathy, forming bonds and perhaps, even some small movements towards social change.	false
building_description_texts_long_description_3k_dlc06_district_residential_landlords_5	A wise ruler pays attention to food production alongside the expansion of the populace: they are as intertwined as the principles of Yin and Yang. \\n\\nIn order to feed its citizens, the city needs a significant amount of land dedicated to cultivating food crops. Rice is the staple, essential for health and prosperity and the basis of almost everyone's diet, but variation is provided by lotus root, various leafy crops, beans and tree-fruits such as plums and oranges. 	false
building_description_texts_long_description_3k_ytr_long_description_district_market_inn_yellow_turban_2	After a long day working in the fields, repairing bridges or bringing in timber, the mind needs rest as much as the body. A drinking house provides a welcoming place to socialise and reflect, either about the day’s work, family problems or even the greater ills that effect the land. \\n\\n A communal gathering place means that the day doesn’t start and end with work, improving the quality of life, increasing the camaraderie in the community and making friends of strangers.	false
building_description_texts_long_description_3k_main_building_long_description_harbour_trader	Development of a jetty into a harbour trader increases commerce into a district at the expense of specialisation. Customers, merchants and visitors can anchor and moor their boats or ships in the harbour, either to sell to merchants, purchase goods or both. \\n\\n Much trade comes via the East and South China Sea routes, from countries as far flung as Tianzhu and Daqir. China's exotic goods are well received in these places, and in high demand.	false
building_description_texts_long_description_3k_main_building_long_description_livestock_farmstead	The construction and extension of more farm buildings around the estate means more livestock can be housed and managed, creating more jobs for the local population. \\n\\n The quality of goods produced by the livestock is increased as conditions improve further, justifying higher selling prices. \\n\\n Additional homes are built upon the estate for the new workers, and the cultivation of livestock by people that live, work and subsist on the results makes for an attractive community. 	false
building_description_texts_long_description_3k_dlc06_district_government_religion_2	The Nanman have always been aware that their mountains are special. The men of the south also know the value of living in harmony with the land, an attitude in accord with the wisdom of the Tao Te Ching.  \\n\\nTaoism flourishes in their territory, with many sacred sites and shrines often carved into the very mountain rock, in the sides of the gorges and ravines that make up their heartlands.	false
building_description_texts_long_description_3k_ytr_long_description_district_military_security_yellow_turban_5	Part of the enemy’s arsenal is the advantage of surprise; when besieging a settlement, they hope to starve the target from aid, gradually weakening them or forcing them to engage in a doomed battle in desperation. \\n\\n A Yellow Turban citadel holds military supplies, such as armour, ammunition, medicine and food. Regular tallies are kept, ensuring that there is always a full complement of supplies, should the worse happen and the settlement become besieged.	false
building_description_texts_long_description_3k_main_building_long_description_tools_manufacturer_province	Though farming is still exhausting work, it has been much improved thanks to the development of new agricultural tools, and the means with which to create them. \\n\\n Simple tools such as hoes and spades, and larger and more complex tools like ploughshares, chain pumps and seed drills greatly increase the efficiency of farming tasks, leading to more food and profit. \\n\\n The tools are held in such regard that miniature spade-coin replicas are still used as currency or a symbol of wealth, though they do tend to ruin pockets!	false
building_description_texts_long_description_3k_main_building_long_description_admin_imperial_palace	The cumulative work of a nation – every detail of its form and construction – represents the abilities of the finest craftsmen, architects, engineers and artists of the land; a matter of pride for the empire and your lasting legacy.\\n\\nSuch a national treasure is kept safe by the finest soldiers the empire can muster. To assault such a garrison without substantial resources would be nothing but folly.	false
building_description_texts_long_description_3k_main_building_long_description_private_workshops_artisan_lacquerware	This district is rich in lacquer trees, indigenous to China, and thus making workshops to create lacquerware possible. \\n\\n The lacquer is cultivated by cutting into the trees and collecting the poisonous sap that dribbles down in the cut ridges. After being treated, it is then applied to manufactured goods to create a decorative varnish (or simply to waterproof the objects). \\n\\n These goods are then sold in the marketplace to bring revenue to the lands, especially as the process of making them is relatively unique (for now) to China. 	false
building_description_texts_long_description_3k_dlc06_city_0	The Nanman may be considered uncivilised by the Han, but the men of the south have a longstanding relationship with the land. Every place that can be settled most likely has been at some time in their long history. \\n\\nThough none now living may remember why this settlement was abandoned, who is to say the place may not flourish again some day soon.	false
building_description_texts_long_description_3k_resource_banditry_white_tiger_yan_shanyue_1	Being a tribal people, the Shanyue are less used to settling in the fixed and decadent cities of the Han, instead more familiar with a life encamped. Although not nomadic, the hill tribes are nevertheless a more pastoral, agricultural peoples. \\n\\n From their camps, they can both tend to their living needs as a people, and also effectively prepare themselves, militarily, for the ever-present and increasing threat of invasion from the north.	false
building_description_texts_long_description_3k_main_building_long_description_kong_rong_grand_public_academy	A grand academy boasts magnificent resources for would-be-scholars; both new and old classic texts are available for study to increase knowledge in the fields of culture, religion and strategy. \\n\\n Mastery of these texts is aided by companion commentaries by elderly scholars that illuminate important passages and readings in the light of modern times and values. \\n\\n Study of past knowledge and how to apply it to modern problems and dilemmas helps people to solve what ails them, leading to a happier population.	false
building_description_texts_long_description_3k_main_building_long_description_grain_estates_grand	Years of toil in the fields have transformed the people here from peasants to expert grain farmers. \\n\\n In their lifetime, they have seen small plots develop into acres of fields, in concert with a growing community. They are filled with pride and a sense of achievement, knowing that their fate has been guided by their own hands and created a thriving farming income. \\n\\n A grand estate is a physical representation of this legacy, and one that will continue with their children after they have gone.	false
building_description_texts_long_description_3k_main_building_long_description_conscription_barracks_enforcement	Not everyone obeys the pull of duty in their hearts, and dissenters and deserters from conscription require a forceful guiding hand to aid them in their service of China. \\n\\n Military absconders are tracked down, regardless of excuses, and 'persuaded' of their true calling – unless of course they can provide payment or a gift in recompense for their absence. \\n\\n Punishment discourages others from ignoring their conscription orders, ensuring the ranks swell as the burden of those miscreants that leech off the land is reduced. 	false
building_description_texts_long_description_3k_main_building_long_description_state_workshops_communal	Government sponsored communal workshops provide work for the local populace, and ensure that the profits from goods and luxuries produced there are done so for the good of China. \\n\\n By linking several workshops together, a larger space can be made for an increased number of goods on production, and tools and expertise can be shared for the improvement of quality. \\n\\n Keeping the workshops under government control means they follow the carefully documented regulations relating to production and profit. 	false
building_description_texts_long_description_3k_main_building_long_description_salt_ponds	When a brine spring is found that continues to provide salt indefinitely, it must be drawing from a deeper source. \\n\\n By careful investigation and excavation, the source can be found to be fully exploited. Once the source is located, the spring can be enlarged out to a salt pond, allowing a greater amount of salt to be gathered. \\n\\n A complex system of bamboo stems and leather valves is used to draw up the briny water over a large surface area, which is then boiled to evaporate the water and leave only the salt residue.	false
building_description_texts_long_description_3k_resource_long_description_tea_tea_grower	The value of tea is such that a whole industry arises from it. Tea bushes are cultivated to provide a mass crop of leaves to pluck, ensuring there is enough tea to sustain the peoples’ need. \\n\\n Tea bricks are made by drying the leaves and compressing them into small blocks, which turns it into a measurable and transportable industry, allowing it to be enjoyed by all.	false
building_description_texts_long_description_3k_main_building_long_description_bandits_lair	A lair is a base for bandits; somewhere they can rest, eat, plan and recruit. \\n\\n New recruits are vouched for by existing members, usually because they have suffered some sort of misfortune. Many are ex-farmers turned to banditry due to the loss of their homes and livelihoods because of natural disaster and war, but some are deserters. \\n\\n Though they are criminals in the eyes of the law, it is preferable to starvation, or punishment for something that they are not responsible for.	false
building_description_texts_long_description_3k_ytr_long_description_district_government_rural_healers_yellow_turban_5	China has been disfigured by natural disasters, the state has fallen into chaos through corruption and neglect, and the people have suffered because of both. \\n\\n Forced from their homes and ruined by exorbitant taxes, the people’s only refuge is the Yellow Turban movement and their support of the poor. \\n\\n All things are connected, and physical healing must occur for prosperity to return. A place where people can confess to the sins that ail them encourages good health, increasing local population growth and replenishment time.	false
building_description_texts_long_description_3k_main_building_long_description_harbour_trading_port	A port, specially developed towards trade, both external and internal, greatly increases the rate of commerce within a region. \\n\\n Ships and boats who do business along the East and South China Sea routes bring in and take out wares to Tianzhu and Daqin, exporting many of China's unique goods, such as silk and lacquerware, as well as resources that are scarce elsewhere, such as salt and iron. \\n\\n The opened trade routes bring in new ideas and experiences as well as commerce, and as such are just as vital to China’s growth.	false
building_description_texts_long_description_3k_ytr_long_description_district_government_yellow_turban_gardens_1	As warlords battle for power, and droughts and famines threaten families, peace can be hard to find. This pain caused by unrest only feeds back into the chaos, so it is important to make room for relaxation. \\n\\n To reconnect with nature and silence the clangourous din of war, one can set aside a little time to visit a garden. Nature not only provides the aesthetic joys of proud trees and delicate flowers but teaches us the way of living with the softness of the breeze and clarity of a still lake. \\n\\n Even a short time can be restorative to a troubled mind, and public order is all the better for it.	false
building_description_texts_long_description_3k_main_building_long_description_turban_temple_eternal_reason	As more people reconcile themselves to the true path, larger places of worship are needed. \\n\\n A temple of eternal reason houses those that teach the ways of piety, abstinence from the evils of alcohol, and encouragement of selfless deeds. It is not the responsibility of peasants to support the wealthy in their endless search for riches and power, but to live and work in harmony. \\n\\nThere is enough space inside to encourage communal activities of chanting and fasting, where all can join under one roof and faith.	false
building_description_texts_long_description_3k_ytr_long_description_district_residential_housing_yellow_turban_3	Balance and harmony are achieved when the people work together with the land, taking and giving in equal measure. \\n\\n The land needs people to till it and raise crops, especially in these times of droughts and famine. Evacuees, drifters and former farmers come here looking to start their lives anew. \\n\\n These houses are large enough that the refugees can bring extended families with them, to remain together and set down roots. Not only does this grow the population in the area, but the crop yield also.	false
building_description_texts_long_description_3k_main_building_long_description_tools_forge	A forge dedicated to the making of tools draws on new agricultural ideas and inventions to ease the farmer’s burden of intensive labour. It increases the amount of food that can be grown and harvested, and increases profits within the district. \\n\\n These agricultural innovations are made possible by comparable advancements in metallurgy; for example, the application of waterwheels to power wind bellows amplify the furnace’s hot air blast, quickening the speed with which metal can be liquefied for casting.	false
building_description_texts_long_description_3k_ytr_long_description_district_government_rural_healers_yellow_turban_4	Everything has an opposite – for example, rough and slippery, sunken and floating. Each needs the other to produce a balance. \\n\\n This is the Ying and Yang, and when it is out of balance either in the state, individual or nature, then sickness follows. To cure it in the body, medicinal elements can be introduced that resonate between the out of balance parts. \\n\\n Though these can be prepared by anyone with common sense and a little knowledge, an apothecary will have the ingredients properly prepared and ready for use.	false

This district lies along the coast, providing easy access to the East and South China Sea routes. \\n\\n Many goods are traded overseas, either directly or through third parties, but the routes are also used for trading within China. \\n\\n The ships leave from port, and then divert down onto the great Yellow River, using it and its tributaries to transport goods and passengers to the other districts.	false

Confucius believed that all have the capacity for goodness, and only study is needed to release their inherent moral and virtuous nature. \\n\\n Confucius did not consider himself a philosophical prophet, but instead a transmitter of ideas from history. Therefore, this shrine’s function is not to worship Confucius himself, but rever his teachings. \\n\\n In practicing those teachings, the shrine’s worshippers improve the lives of those around them by treating all as equals.	false

Goods and items taken from enemy settlements are delivered to designated collection points and accounted for by trustworthy volunteers. \\n\\n Without an organised checking system and records, it is little more than banditry and unworthy of the Yellow Turban way. This way, more of the plunder reaches those who need it, as well as destabilising enemies.	false
building_description_texts_long_description_3k_dlc06_gate_pass_5	One wall in China will always be used as a comparison for all others: the wall built along the northern border during the Qin dynasty. As well as keeping out invaders, it served to both comfort and contain the folk within. \\n\\nThough the Great Wall itself has become something of a patchwork by this time, and in some regards a shadow of its former self, emulating its great intention remains a grand statement. Considerable effort goes into constructing a defensive wall on this scale; the need to buttress it and add protective crenulations, and the finishing touch of a proper gatehouse, mean the advantages of such a structure cannot be overrated.	false
building_description_texts_long_description_3k_main_building_long_description_bandits_hideout	Like soldiers, bandits need somewhere to recover following a raid – sleep, eat, and make new plans. A hideout gives bandits somewhere to lay low, should their activities attract too much 'heat' from the authorities. \\n\\n Though they are merely fighting to survive along with everyone else, the nature of banditry means that anyone could potentially be a target, and thus they make a lot of enemies along the way. A hideout is where people can be recruited into a clan, if they can prove their mettle of course.	false

A Taoist temple provides the people a place where they can learn how to divest themselves of poisonous greed. \\n\\n To remain healthy in spirit and body, the energy source of qi must be preserved; practicing celibacy or a minimal diet will prevent qi from escaping the body, and repentance in a Chamber of Silence helps to absolve on of sin, and therefore, sickness.	false

The village has expanded into a town, as income and trade brings in commerce to fund new buildings and homes. \\n\\n The expansion creates opportunities for new businesses to open up, to directly or indirectly support the cargo trade, and what started as a simple coastal village, becomes a bustling hub of a network of sea trade and transport.	false

This village prides itself on its fishing tradition, where techniques, as well as tall tales, are handed down through the generations. \\n\\n A large fishing net will catch a haul plentiful enough to feed a family, and still have extra to sell to those who lack the stomach to catch and gut their own supper.	false

To be a true warlord, and to meet and negotiate with others of their ilk, suitable surroundings are needed. A palace is a statement of intent, proof that they have become a viable candidate for emperor. \\n\\n With this new authority, public order and trade are improved, and corruption is reduced.	false

A hall is a more impressive building than a mere shrine, and though it requires an increase in tributes from the vassals, their grumblings are a minor irritant compared to the extra funds raised. \\n\\n It is also a sign of authority and permanence to show that the bandit forces are no fleeting disaster to be weathered, such as a flood or drought, but a new power to submit to at the risk of incurring the bandit's wrath.	false

Just as farmers need tools to work the land, artisans need precise tools to craft their work and realise their vision. \\n\\n An artisan tool depot provides artisanal, as well as some agricultural, tools, increasing revenue from food, income and trade.	false
building_description_texts_long_description_3k_main_building_long_description_han_admin_commandery	Taxation is not a tool to fill the purses of the rich, but to raise funds for the management of the land. \\n\\n Under Liu Bei’s administration, civil servants are educated with a guiding framework based on moral rectitude and fairness to benefit the population; it is still possible to collect the required taxes for maintenance, repairs and salaries without punishing the poor. \\n\\n Each official has a duty to report any wrongdoing by their colleagues, so that any corrupting influence is quickly excised from the administration.	false

No matter who rules China, these resources will remain key to its health, and the finding and collection of either is a primary concern. \\n\\n Iron ore from mining provides materials to build ploughs and other tools for agriculture, architectural structures and military weapons; any surplus can be traded. \\n\\n The work is back breaking and dangerous, but where willing workers are scarce, convicted criminals can be pressed into service as punishment and atonement.	false

With the proper facilities and equipment, both the quality and quantity of objects your artisans can craft will increase.  \\n\\nA roomy workshop with racks of tools kept clean and in good order is always a worthwhile investment.

To serve the people fully, and to prevent bureaucracy from becoming a barrier rather than a useful system, more administrative officials are employed. \\n\\n Each official has been recruited through recommendation by respected seniors, and has studied the texts of Confucianism as a framework for just government, reducing the chances of corruption and raising Liu Bei’s diplomatic standing.	false

Grains such as hemp, millet, beans, wheat and chi are the most popular crops, depending on the time of season; millet for the summer, wheat and barley in winter. \\n\\n The work is hard, but has been made easier because of advances in agricultural practices. The seeds are planted using the alternating fields system, where the furrows and ridges are alternated to keep the soil fertile all year around. 	false

building_description_texts_long_description_3k_dlc06_gate_pass_4	As walls become stronger and higher, their foundations must become firmer and deeper. Raising walls like this takes a lot of work: fortunately there is usually a ready supply of conscripts and convicts on tap. \\n\\nOf course, barriers can be seen from either side, and so one that can never be breached may be as much a hindrance as an asset: hence the construction of a gate. Lookouts along the ramparts and battlements can let you know whether a friend or enemy approaches.	false
building_description_texts_long_description_3k_dlc06_district_market_trade_3	A thriving market is vital to feed a bustling city, where most people have neither the time nor means to produce their own food.

building_description_texts_long_description_3k_main_building_long_description_security_partisans	A settlement’s defences must always be ready to repel enemy attack. Bolstering the guard and raising the alarm when the enemy is already at the gates is of little use, especially as a besiegement rapidly narrows one’s options for aid and supplies.

When armies are in remote areas, or far from their own supply lines, the danger of starvation or sickness can do as much damage as a surprise ambush or rain of arrows. \\n\\n The tuntian system organises soldiers to build and work farms, so that food can be grown to feed and supply allies in the local area. This increases food in the area and the replenishment of fresh troops to nearby armies.	false

Taxation is controlled by county administrators, who ensure that the population is registered – so that they can be taxed and, in the event of a missed payment, traced. \\n\\n These payments are then reviewed by the Minister of Finance, who will make no exceptions and show no leniency, regardless of any extenuating circumstances.

Instead of relying purely on numbers, the rebellion must employ cunning and use the support of the people; the ability to mobilise quickly and exploit opportunities will be a vital factor in securing victory. \\n\\n Campsites where the loot of enemy settlements is stored provide not only funds for the cause, but a base to organise an ambush should the chance present itself.	false

building_description_texts_long_description_3k_ytr_long_description_district_residential_housing_yellow_turban_5	A housing district for the peasants that work in the field can accommodate a larger number of people, and therefore hands, in the field. \\n\\n Farming is long, hard work and requires a good deal of mental and spiritual commitment to manage the physical toll. Prove to the peasants that their wellbeing is important by providing homes for them, and they will work with heart and will as well as their bodies. \\n\\n Here, peasants are better placed to enjoy the fruits of their labours and the divide between work and living is reduced, meaning better crops and a fairer and more harmonious society.	false

building_description_texts_long_description_3k_main_building_long_description_grain_rice_paddies_irrigated	The most vital element for the growing of rice is a plentiful supply of water to flood the paddies with. Though this province is blessed with regular heavy rainfall, the water supply can be increased by the manipulation of nearby water sources. \\n\\n Paddies can be placed below steep inclines for streams to flow into, or rivers can be diverted towards outlets into the paddies to create a constant flow of water for the rice. Larger harvests of rice mean more food, income and population growth to the county.	false

A lack of town defences is perceived as vulnerability and an invitation to attack and plunder. A basic level of security is therefore achieved by assigning the most reliable of garrisoned conscripts to regular patrols. \\n\\n These patrols follow a fixed route of inspections of possible breach points around the perimeter; damaged walls are reported, suspicious strangers are challenged, and the alarm is raised if a full attack is launched.	false
building_description_texts_long_description_3k_ytr_long_description_district_government_yellow_turban_gardens_5	A public park for all to enjoy greatly increases the satisfaction and public order within the community. It allows a place of quietness to ruminate and reflect in. \\n\\n Meditation can be undertaken here, so that the people can gain a greater access to the inner and outer of their lives, restoring their Qi and banishing any sickness that plagues them. \\n\\n Once the inner self is calmed, then it is easier to go out into the world again and help restoring the outer self by working towards the Great Peace.	false

building_description_texts_long_description_3k_dlc06_district_residential_logistics_2	No one can say for sure when rice was first grown but without it China would never have achieved the greatness it enjoys. A crop that grows quickly and abundantly, takes up relatively little space, and can be stored almost indefinitely after harvesting is a great boon. \\n\\nMaking space to store rice, and other foodstuffs that keep well, is a sensible precaution every ruler should consider. The larger the storage depot, the more useful it will be. 	false
building_description_texts_long_description_3k_ytr_long_description_district_labour_housing_yellow_turban_1	China’s spiritual turmoil is made manifest in natural disasters; flooding has destroyed the homes and livelihoods of many people and untethered them from their roots, forcing them into destitution as they roam the land searching for new work. \\n\\n A poor barracks provides some shelter and resources for the unfortunate and encourages the growth of a small community, who can once again look to the future with some hope.	false

building_description_texts_long_description_3k_main_building_long_description_logistics_grain_silo	A grain silo can contain a much larger volume of grain, supplying a larger number of people with food than a basic store. \\n\\n The large structure keeps the grains safe from floods and disaster and, up to a point, also prevents theft by raiders or bandits – either barbarians from the north looking for easy food, or enemies attempting to disrupt the supply of food to opposing armies, preventing rapid troop replenishment as a result.	false
building_description_texts_long_description_3k_main_building_long_description_harbour_grand_trading_port	A grand trading port accommodates many ships, either leaving or returning from trade in the South and East China Seas. Like the tides, for every shipment and crew that arrives there are those preparing to leave, and the port is noisy with activity as a result; it is loaded with luxuries such as lacquerware and silks, livestock of cattle, pigs and sheep, and foodstuffs like grain, dried fish and spices. The goods are matched in variety by the people who profit from the port, such as sailors, fishermen and market traders.	false
building_description_texts_long_description_3k_main_building_long_description_admin_palace	A palace is a grand work of architecture worthy of the power and authority of a faction leader. \\n\\n More than a building of governance, it is a statement of intent towards those enemies who would look to thwart ambition and injure China by preventing its righteous leader’s rise to power. \\n\\n The greater world will look upon it with envy as an example of China’s complex systems of government and bureaucracy. It is the highest dwelling in the land, and as such commands a larger garrison to defend it and maintain public order.	false
building_description_texts_long_description_3k_main_building_long_description_bandits_headquarters	Bandits are deemed to be criminals because they refuse to bow to their oppressors. They steal no more than soldiers and what they steal, they confess to and do not pretend it is to ‘maintain justice’. It is this honesty, and the lure of taking back power that continues to attract the disenfranchised to bandit forces. \\n\\n A bandit headquarters will see to the administration – much like a ‘real’ army – of their forces, enabling a force to be refreshed more quickly with new or rested recruits.	false

The powerful have oppressed their subjects for too long, boasting of Mandates of Heaven while idling in palaces, indulging unseemly vices and luxuriating in fine silk robes. \\n\\n This is at the cost of the people they should be serving, who break their backs to prop up these hypocritical parasites. Emancipation can only be gained through enlightenment, and the people will be shown the light to restore balance.	false
building_description_texts_long_description_3k_main_building_long_description_trade_port_officer	A port officer, trained in local statutes and ordnances, oversees business undertakings at the port and makes reports on unlawful or suspicious dealings. \\n\\n As ports naturally see a large volume of strangers coming and going, all sorts of unsavoury characters may arrive to cause trouble. \\n\\n However, conversely, a port officer can act as a point of contact for friendly espionage agents, helping them establish cover with aliases and adding their names to the merchant register to provide cover for them.	false
building_description_texts_long_description_3k_main_building_long_description_silk_road_market	A silk market will go some way to meeting the high demand for silks, and open up new avenues for profit and trade. Traders submit their claim for a stall, and receive one based on the quantity and quality of their stock and reputation. \\n\\n The most successful traders are rewarded with the prime pitches central to the marketplace, and lesser traders must share the smaller plots around the perimeter. However, no matter the stall, each trader ends the day in profit, bringing in more income to the province.	false

The farm’s crops are grown primarily for the military forces to ensure they have a steady supply of food while defending a county or fighting local skirmishes. \\n\\n It can serve as a hub to return to after battle, in order to recover and replenish lost soldiers at a faster rate. A small selection of the farming peasantry is armed, providing some protection from sabotage at a small cost.	false

They have been seen as a class apart, displaying neither the stolid earthy honesty of the dependable peasant nor the inherent nobility and cultivated sophistication of the ruling classes.\\n\\nBut their importance, and hence status, is growing.

The role of a magistrate holds many responsibilities, chiefly the raising of a garrison to suppress crime and maintain law and order, and the collection of taxes from registered households. Without careful administration, the new Zhong dynasty would collapse into chaos as surely as the doomed Han.	false

A deluge of arrows, fired as a body from range, injures, kills, and has a devastating effect on enemy morale. \\n\\n Conscripts are observed in training to spot those who possess archery skills, and the best will be equipped with a bow. Composite bows are particularly useful for use on horseback, as they can be made to a smaller construction without sacrificing the energy of the longer, single-piece bow designs. 	false

building_description_texts_long_description_3k_main_building_long_description_state_workshops_gov_provincial	Government workshops, built to control both production and profits of goods and luxuries, increase the amount of income from industry. \\n\\n As wealth starts being shared among merchants as well as land owners, the state must take control to avoid being undercut by private businesses. \\n\\n One of the advantages of this is that the work can be undertaken by conscripts and convicts, drastically reducing the cost of wages and ensuring a greater yield of profit for the good of China.	false
building_description_texts_long_description_3k_main_building_long_description_grain_rice_paddies	Heavy and regular rainfall occurs over this county, making it extremely good arable for cultivating rice paddies. Rice is an important diet staple – its crops have a high yield, and once grown, can be distributed among the populace to easily feed many large families. \\n\\n Unlike most food crops, the fertility of the soil is less important than regular rainfall or a nearby source of water. The rice seedlings are planted, and the field is flooded to encourage growth until it is ready to be harvested.	false
building_description_texts_long_description_3k_main_building_long_description_grain_rice_fields	The hunter-gatherer role has long been subsumed by the farmer, and lands with good, fertile soil must be sought out for farming. This province has an abundance of arable land, and the local climate is conducive to the environment crops need to thrive. \\n\\n There are many sources of water nearby that lend themselves to paddy-field agriculture, so that rice, a major food staple of China’s diet, can be grown here. Workers are then recruited to start preparing the fields ready for the crops.	false

Merchants can trade in greater bulk, without having to accommodate unsold items, and can have a larger variety of stock on hand should customers demand it, leading to further sales and greater profit.	false

Therefore, clarity of intent is vital, and the careful documentation of laws, proposals for public works and other communication needs a secretariat. \\n\\n The secretariat keeps immaculate records and registries for the capital, and vastly improves the running of the district, including the raising of a larger garrison.	false

building_description_texts_long_description_3k_main_building_long_description_grain_agricultural_garrison_fortress	A safer, though no less effective, way of striking at the enemy is to sabotage and destroy the supply of resources on which they rely. \\n\\n The essential fuel of any army is food, and so the loss of this supply would slowly deplete their ranks through starvation, leaving survivors weakened and demoralised. \\n\\n The building of a fortress around the farms within this province will protect the food supply from enemy attacks, increasing the replenishment rate of local armies and the locals garrisoned within.	false
building_description_texts_long_description_3k_main_building_long_description_gongsun_zan_military_admin_commandery	A commandery houses a staff of officials whose duties include the enforcement of law and order. \\n\\n During wartime, each civilian is a potential soldier and must stand ready against all enemies; this administration organises a garrison to aid in the suppression of crime, as well as providing rules to prevent those in the garrison abusing their temporary authority. \\n\\n Garrison duty provides a valuable grounding of military discipline for future military service, increasing the experience of those that train here.	false
building_description_texts_long_description_3k_main_building_long_description_livestock_estate	Once a farm has been established, the lands around it can be bought up and expanded into an estate. \\n\\n Small homes are built to rent to local peasants, and the farm becomes somewhat self-sufficient; the peasants find work at the farm and consume the food produced at it, and their rent pays towards the upkeep of the farm, so it can continually expand operations. \\n\\n This micro-economy increases income and food in the province, and the promise of regular work and homes attracts those looking to make a life in China.	false

These elite cavalry units were of the same breed that Gongsun Zan used to defend China’s borders against barbarian invaders. \\n\\n Only the purest of white horses are selected for training, chosen because they are considered sacred animals, thus invoking fear in the enemy when ridden into battle. \\n\\n The horses are conditioned against the noise and chaos of battle to ensure a stronger charge in battle, making for fearsome opponents. 	false

Naturally, talk turns to news and rumours, often providing a welcome fresh perspective on events. \\n\\n Captivated by good conversation and company, the officers spend their coin freely, contributing to the area’s financial well-being as well as their own.	false
building_description_texts_long_description_3k_main_building_long_description_lumber_bamboo_timber_storage	Bamboo is harvested for construction when its stalks reach their greatest height, and when sugar sap is at its lowest. The higher the sugar sap in bamboo, the more likely that it will become infested from pests and insects, quickly ruining the stalks. \\n\\n Once collected, the bamboo is pumped through with water to force out excess sap, and then left in the storehouse to dry out; the storehouse provides a cool environment to prevent the cracking that occurs in hot weather. 	false
building_description_texts_long_description_3k_main_building_long_description_admin_palace_magistrate	A civil servant – maybe a descendant of a line of venerable bureaucrats – understands that the roots and branches of administration must be equally strong to be efficient; each branch must stretch for ambition without suppressing the other’s reach, while the root supports all. \\n\\n This is achieved by carefully delineating roles within the service. A magistrate organises the raising of a garrison for security, as well as collecting taxes from registered households.	false
building_description_texts_long_description_3k_dlc06_city_8	A maze of paved streets and alleys run between buildings which utilise all the available space. Even so, the city's expansion is always planned with symmetry and harmony in mind and executed with care; long terraces snake around the slopes of ravines and from a distance the city's roofs are a pleasing sweep of upswept gable-ends. \\n\\nWhole districts are given over to specialist industries, and commercial districts provide for every need.

Any businessman knows that the most profitable deals are made through informal liaisons, and intercepting officials at rest opens new trade opportunities. \\n\\n In return, the officials gently prod the traders for any hearsay around their locales, learning of any new potential business rivals so that they may circumvent or undercut them and increase profits.	false

Too long has the corrupt government starved its people, exploiting them in the fields while profiting off their sweat and blood. \\n\\n They have proved themselves wanting of the dictums of Heaven, as confirmed by the cosmic shift from fire to earth. \\n\\n A shrine built under the new Yellow Sky shows the people the true path to the Great Peace; let this be a haven where the sick can reflect on the illnesses that are punishment of guilt, and absolve themselves of it.	false
building_description_texts_long_description_3k_main_building_long_description_logistics_granary_grand	A grand granary holds enough grain to feed the population and have a surplus for future commerce. Release of grain stocks at low prices occurs if merchants try to artificially raise prices and not just during times of crop failure and famine. \\n\\n Enough grain is kept to ensure that the city does not starve should it be besieged, allowing more time for reinforcements to arrive before surrender is the only remaining option.	false
building_description_texts_long_description_3k_main_building_long_description_grain_rice_paddies_communal	Though rice paddies have high yields, they are very labour intensive. The sowing of seeds, protecting the crops from pests and cultivation of the rice requires many hands. To mitigate this, independent farmers can join their fields to form communal rice paddies. \\n\\n Workers, tools, techniques and experience are shared for mutual benefit. The flooding of fields is done on a larger scale, and the crops sown and harvested in rotation, so there is always a new crop starting as another is harvested. \\n\\n Each farmer will not weather bad luck alone, but instead has the support of their neighbours, and all share in the profits.	false
building_description_texts_long_description_3k_main_building_long_description_trade_port_trading_association	The formation of a port trading association allows a framework for merchants to join in a guild to support and promote each other’s business. \\n\\n Where two separate businesses may need goods from another to function, they can now work together and even provide those items at a discount for good relations and a mutual boost in profit from the resulting sales. \\n\\n Such arrangements, having somewhat more organised and clear working practices, are also more acceptable to the government and thus reduce official interference. 	false

Confucius teaches that one must instead look inwards, and to each other, as the source of real strength. Harmony is achieved through the here and now; spirituality in corporeal, not otherworldly, virtues. \\n\\n Confucius, in his wisdom, spoke of the Tian, guiding him and giving him a unique place in reality; through the Tian he sought to teach us how to bridge the divide between man and heaven, by creating trust and harmony within ourselves, and with those close to us.	false

As these posts are meeting points between commanderies for messengers, they are places where news and rumours collect, and information is exchanged. \\n\\n However, a rider cannot talk for long; their job is to deliver urgent communications between post stations, and a horseback postal officer is expected to cover at least 200 li over a day and night or suffer a flogging as punishment.	false

A tributary court is demonstrative of that authority and proof that a bandit lord is just as deserving of tribute as any noble lord. \\n\\n Loyal officials receive and record the tributes, quietly silencing any complaints with a warning of what happened to those who dared default on a payment.	false

building_description_texts_long_description_3k_main_building_long_description_iron_craftwork_town	This province is famed for its skills with iron, and its wares are in demand. The revenue from past successes is reinvested into the building of more homes, craft workshops and the hiring of more artisans. \\n\\n High selling items are selected for increased mass production, and new similar pieces are commissioned to capitalise on current tastes to entice new customers. \\n\\n It now functions as a producer of high quality iron craftwork, bringing stability to the population living and working there, and a boost to its income.	false
building_description_texts_long_description_3k_main_building_long_description_state_workshops_public	The increased demand for goods and luxuries has led to the rapid rise of entrepreneurs of private business, keen to take advantage. \\n\\n However, the employment of civilians as merchants, tradesmen, craftsmen and artisans means less people working the land in farms, and lessening income from land taxes. \\n\\n The answer is to have state owned workshops, where the profits and goods can be controlled by the government for the good of China, rather than the select few; as the industry grows, so does China. 	false

building_description_texts_long_description_ep_building_long_description_government_inspectors_office_3	An inspector to the provinces is responsible for scrutinising government activity in regions far from the capital. Once the sole authority in any given area, they now work with, and nominally beneath, the local governor. \\n\\n The governor is responsible for all executive decisions, the inspector merely advises. However, in times of crisis, the inspector is authorised to raise troops and command them personally, as required.	false

Following the same fixed patrol night after night is monotonous, and when the mind is wearied by tedium, it will beg for change and become distracted. \\n\\n A guard post alleviates this attrition by providing a base for guards to reconvene or be relived after their shift. Potential threats are spotted and intercepted much earlier, and the guards can always combat their boredom by harassing trespassers. 	false

building_description_texts_long_description_3k_main_building_long_description_labour_bureau_mining_subs	A bureau of mining subsidiaries manages the running of iron and salt mines. A district blessed with iron or salt resources has the potential for a great deal of revenue if organised properly. \\n\\n As such, a number of officials and junior officials educated in the workings of industry have been assigned to administrative posts here. \\n\\n The officials manage the hiring of private or corvée miners, acquisition of tools and determine when a mine has been exhausted, or no longer profitable, all of which increases profit. 	false

Accidents involving the felling of trees, dropping timber during transportation and incidents simply from sheer exhaustion can take a toll on the workers. \\n\\n A camp, situated near the pine or bamboo forest, gives weary workers a place to retire and rest after their toil. With a clearer head, tragedies are less likely to occur, making the work more attractive to migrants looking for work.	false

building_description_texts_long_description_3k_main_building_long_description_fishing_public_jetties	A fishing village is improved with the construction of a jetty. This structure extends out away from the shallows of the coast, reaching out over deeper waters where larger fish gather. \\n\\n Underneath its shadow, smaller fish congregate to use it for shelter, attracting larger predators, who in turn become easy pickings for the fisherman above. \\n\\n By walking to the end of the jetty and casting nets, those fishermen without boats can fish, leading to a much larger haul for the village, and an increase in food and income.	false

Bamboo is an incredibly versatile building material, used in bridges, mines and writing materials. \\n\\n Weapons too, can be fashioned from bamboo, and the warehouse here improves the quality of spears made in the district.	false

If the poison of corruption is allowed to fester among the roots of rural government, it will soon spread to the upper echelons, tainting all. \\n\\n Liu Bei’s officials are selected for integrity as well as bureaucratic skill, to serve with justice and enhance his reputation as a kind and just ruler.	false

As China relies on the peasant community to produce their food, so too should it value each peasant as vital and equal if harmony is to be restored. \\n\\n Those who live in a peasant commune all share in the responsibilities, resources and profits, granting them a greater stake in what they produce. More food is produced, and the population grows steadily as a result.	false

building_description_texts_long_description_3k_main_building_long_description_logistics_grain_store	Grains are a hardy, long-lasting, staple foodstuff, and a grain store takes up a relatively small space for the number of people it can feed. \\n\\n Harvested by the peasant farmers of the land, and then stored for redistribution and sale later, stores provide a ready supply of nourishment. \\n\\n As animals store food for the long hard winter months ahead, so grain is stored for those times when the harvest is poor or crops are destroyed by flood.	false
building_description_texts_long_description_3k_main_building_long_description_harbour_pier	This district is near to a port or river, and thus a pier can be built to take full advantage of maritime commerce. \\n\\n Piers allow for fishing and the docking of small boats for trade going in or out of a village, increasing its income and naturally providing more work for the local populace as well. \\n\\n In time, if developed, having a pier could change a village into a fully-fledged maritime city.	false
building_description_texts_long_description_3k_main_building_long_description_inn_hostel	After a long and wearying journey, a guest house provides respite for the travelling officer. \\n\\n Officials of all disciplines congregate here along their journeys, and the guest house has a large common area where they can meet and discuss China's ills and what may be done about them. \\n\\n The informality of a guest house means those who would never cross paths officially are now free to speculate, exchange information and conduct business without professional bias.	false

building_description_texts_long_description_3k_main_building_long_description_spice_route_caravan_post	To increase profits, a trader must travel and seek out customers. A caravan post facilitates the travel of caravans along the trade route. \\n\\n Spices are hard wearing and do not spoil easily, but can lose taste and colour, so they are packed as airtight as possible to preserve quality. Once packed, the containers are loaded onto pack animals and a route is planned. \\n\\n On return, any unsold spices are checked and added to the post’s inventory and a greater quantity of the most popular spices loaded onto the next caravan.	false
building_description_texts_long_description_3k_main_building_long_description_labour_camp_drifter	China’s spiritual turmoil is made manifest in natural disasters; flooding has destroyed the homes and livelihoods of many people and untethered them, forcing them into destitution as they roam the land searching for new work. \\n\\n A workforce camp provides the beginnings of a new life for many drifters, where they receive a small wage in return for local maintenance and repair work. \\n\\n A small community begins to form within the camp through shared circumstance, and word is sent out to relatives that work can be found here. 	false

building_description_texts_long_description_3k_main_building_long_description_state_workshops_grand_mint	A grand treasury mint, charged with the production of the land’s currency, brings stability in a time of flux and uncertainty. \\n\\n With almost all facets of currency production – even the copper ore used for the minting process – overseen by official bodies, any corruption from counterfeiting or bribery takes a crippling blow. \\n\\n Old coins are collected and melted down to be reminted into the new legal tender, and the new coins are of such quality that forgery becomes almost impossible without expensive tools. 	false
building_description_texts_long_description_3k_main_building_long_description_copper_mining_town	Revenue from this district's copper industry is reinvested to develop the village into a full town. Thus, the people here have regular work, homes and income, and are somewhat more in control of their own fates. Mining is still dangerous and hard work, but the labourers can see the rewards of it as the town grows in trade and industry. The expertise and wealth generated from the town opens new opportunities for its inhabitants, should they wish to explore other avenues in the future.	false
building_description_texts_long_description_3k_main_building_long_description_port_coastal_trading_port	A port especially developed towards trade, both external and internal, greatly increases the rate of commerce within the region. \\n\\n Ships and boats who do business along the East and South China Sea routes bring in and take out wares to Tianzhu and Daqir, exporting many of the unique goods China produces, such as silk and lacquerware, as well as resources scarce elsewhere, such as salt and iron. \\n\\n The opening of sea trade routes bring new ideas and experiences as well as commerce, and are just as vital to China’s growth. 	false

It can be intimidating at first, but once they have aligned themselves with its pulse, they will become part of it. \\n\\n This metropolis has been built from the fruits of the faction’s successes, extending old buildings with new constructions, merging the old and new and entering into a symbiosis with not only the commandery’s resources, but the fortunes and misfortunes of its people.	false
building_description_texts_long_description_3k_resource_long_description_tea_tea_plantation	China’s climate and regular rainfall are perfectly suited to the growing of tea, but there are still many factors pertaining to its quality, particularly during the picking of the leaves. \\n\\n As with many things, patience ultimately rewards; plants at higher elevations grow slower, but the taste will benefit from an improved taste. \\n\\n Younger leaves, picked from pruned plants, also yield a greater taste. As tea becomes more popular – and profitable – the methods of cultivation are refined.	false

building_description_texts_long_description_3k_main_building_long_description_private_workshops	Private workshops produce commercial goods, increasing income for the district. Technological advances and a blossoming of new trade routes create an opportunity for trade and commerce to flourish. \\n\\n Demand for unique goods from China come from the wealthy, but cheaper, mass produced goods are also popular with the lower classes, and China now has foreign customers as far as Daqin and Tianzhu. Private workshops are the first step in taking full advantage of this burgeoning trade boom. 	false
building_description_texts_long_description_3k_main_building_long_description_kong_rong_grand_academy_poetry	Blunt words may have a clarity, but can have a dulled impact on their audience, and ignored as mild weather. Sometimes, ideas – and even arguments – require poetry to pierce the indifference of others, to reach and inspire them to action. \\n\\n In times of strife, art and culture can easily be undervalued in the rush for power, but without it humanity loses sight of its reflection and risks plunging farther from heaven’s light. A grand academy educates all in poetry, offering balance and expression to the masses.	false
building_description_texts_long_description_3k_main_building_long_description_grain_farms_communal	This co-operative generates greater amounts of food for the province, which encourages more people to move here for both food and work. \\n\\n As more farmers move to the province looking to find work in the fields, there is much to be gained by pooling collective resources and experience to make communal grain farms. Agricultural tools and techniques can be shared, as well as resulting profits from the yields. \\n\\n If one farmer’s crop encounters disaster and fails, they can count on the support of the farming community.	false
building_description_texts_long_description_3k_main_building_long_description_sun_jian_merchant_guard_post	Traders and merchants are considered by some to be the lowest in China’s social order; trade is considered an exploitative of the labours of others, and a dishonourable pursuit. \\n\\n However, these old prejudices are quickly disappearing as China is experiencing a new successful era in trade and commerce. \\n\\n Land and sea routes provide trade expansion across borders, but can also be target for bandits and enemies. A merchant guard post supplies some security for tradesmen, protecting their goods and increasing profits. 	false

building_description_texts_long_description_3k_main_building_long_description_conscription_training_camp	On the battlefield, every soldier’s life depends on the others; mutual trust is vital, and all must fight as family. \\n\\n Such bonds are formed in a training camp, where recruits live and train together, safe from the petty distractions of the civilian populace. Here, the recruits gain military pride and forge bonds with each other. \\n\\n After all, if the temptation of gambling or alcohol from the town proves too much to resist, discrete and loyal friends are invaluable to cover an absence from the next morning’s drill.	false

Through poetry’s metaphors, thoughts are focused on things often overlooked, revealing to us what we know but fail to consider; to listen, not simply to hear. \\n\\n An academy brings poetry’s subtle arts to the masses, enriching even the poorest soul with culture and heritage, so that they may document their own stories for future generations.	false
building_description_texts_long_description_3k_main_building_long_description_gov_support_commandery_irrigation	By harnessing and controlling water, crops can be grown faster, and a much more even overall growth can be achieved. \\n\\n Many parts of China benefit from good, regular rainfall, but there is also the famed Yellow River and its tributaries, which can be directed along canals and channels leading to the fields. \\n\\n This increases the yield produced, the dependability of farms, and the likelihood of good crops being grown.	false
building_description_texts_long_description_3k_main_building_long_description_port_coastal_trading_town	Commerce in China is no longer frowned upon by the many, but considered a vital part of this district’s lifeblood. \\n\\n Encouraged by the booming coastal trade in this district, entrepreneurs are attracted to ply their own business ideas to help develop the town, and of course line their own pockets with profits. \\n\\n As new business ventures spring up, the town receives a boost to their economy, and creeps closer to a self-sustaining region, where imports and exports continue to grow.	false

Metal is heated until it reaches melting point, before being poured into a clay mould and left to cool. Once the metal has cooled and hardened, the mould is removed, revealing the final item. \\n\\n This casting can be done with single piece casts, or if the item is more complicated, made up of several different pieces. This process speeds up the production of weapons as well as maintaining a uniformity in the weapons due to the moulds.	false
building_description_texts_long_description_3k_ytr_long_description_district_artisan_manufacturing_workshops_yellow_turban_5	The desire for luxury goods is growing in China. Trade routes in and out of China increase the availability of goods and the speed of delivery of goods produced here. Silk and spices are increasingly popular, so trade markets are becoming a major source of income for the land. \\n\\n To ignore this opportunity is to starve the Yellow Turbans of much needed financial support, and so workshops for manufacturing luxury items are built and the profits put towards the endeavours for the Great Peace.	false
building_description_texts_long_description_3k_main_building_long_description_port_spice_trading_town	The demand for spices is high, and becoming more and more popular with people as a way of adding complexity to their dishes. \\n\\n China produces and exports its own spices, but many too are imported from Tianzhu, and a spice trading port can take advantage of the South and East China Sea routes to increase commerce within the region. \\n\\n The lucrative trade partnership expands China’s standing in the eyes of the world and brings many new opportunities for commerce within and without.	false

It takes an understanding of the enemy that cannot come from studying them from afar. To be amongst them is to learn their ways, their strengths, and how they might be defeated. \\n\\n Yet it is not so simple to just enter the enemy citadels and absorb information; the ways of infiltration and espionage must be taught if the 'noble' way is to be learned, then mimicked, then defeated.	false

building_description_texts_long_description_3k_ytr_long_description_district_government_yellow_turban_gardens_4	A still mind takes much training and patience, and to achieve it requires a quiet place to practice. A walled garden is a refuge from the noise and clamour of everyday life, where people can be assured of a peaceful environment to meditate and sit in silent observation. \\n\\n The plants, flowers, water features and animals of the garden show how one can be in tune with nature by accepting a state of being outside of thinking, restoring their Qi and health.	false

A brine spring is a natural occurrence that can be tapped for its salt reserves, then extracting the salt through the open pan method.\\n\\n  Though a brine spring only supplies a small amount, it must be drawing from a larger body of seawater, and early investment may lead to greater returns in the future.	false

China consists chiefly of arable land because of its rainfall and famed Yellow River with its many tributaries. \\n\\n These canals and rivers can be diverted and channelled towards farmland to provide water all year around, and more than that, can be controlled with chain pumps to raise or lower the height of the water. \\n\\n When twinned with rotation of crops to take advantage of the seasons, greater income and food revenue is created.	false
building_description_texts_long_description_3k_ytr_long_description_district_residential_farming_yellow_turban_1	The allocation of small plots of land for local people to farm increases the income generated from the food they produce. \\n\\n Land is examined for healthy soil and proximity to rivers and streams for future irrigation. Once suitable areas are mapped out, they are divided among the settlement’s peasant households to ensure all have an equal plot to work. \\n\\n This allows the farmers to become more self-sufficient and have a greater control over the profits made from their work.	false

So, too, is banditry a life of ideals – either vengeance or dogma pushes one to draw the blade, so potential recruits must also have that ideology reinforced, ere they are to join the fight. \\n\\n To recruit a bandit, therefore, is to recruit both the body and the mind, so that both are in perfect harmony.	false

Where two separate businesses may rely on an exchange of goods, they can come to an agreement to provide items at a discount in the interest of good relations and long-term, mutual profit. \\n\\n Such arrangements, having more organised and transparent working practices, are more acceptable to the government, reducing their need to interfere.	false

building_description_texts_long_description_3k_ytr_long_description_district_artisan_artisan_workshops_yellow_turban_3	The amulets produced here are beautifully made, and certainly have a decorative aspect to them, but their main use is to protect the wearer from harm by warding off evil influences. \\n\\n Each amulet has a square or circular hole in the centre to bind or hang it and both sides are carved with images around the hole. \\n\\n These are usually a combination of Chinese characters issuing some warning to evil threats with images of gods from the Taoist pantheon, to imbue the words with authority.	false
building_description_texts_long_description_3k_main_building_long_description_iron_veins	Iron is needed for forging tools, weapons and decorative arts, but first it needs to be found and extracted from the earth. Observance and investigation of anomalous land formations leads to the tracking and locating of deposits of natural minerals, such as iron veins. \\n\\n These veins are tapped, pulling from the heat of the earth to make iron for war, as well as other industrial commodities. The work is long and arduous, but a land gifted with iron resources has the advantage over others, and must be exploited fully.	false
building_description_texts_long_description_3k_main_building_long_description_equipment_military_armourer	This district is rich with iron resources, and military armour-makers make their home here. These experts have long honed their craft into an art, applying new smithing techniques to forge improved armour. \\n\\n There are no warriors so skilled that they can deflect every attack; battle is chaotic, and danger comes from all sides and distances. \\n\\n Although armour cannot stop every spear, bow or blade, it provides a greater defence than a mere tunic, and will embolden the wearer to charge more readily into close combat.	false
building_description_texts_long_description_3k_main_building_long_description_admin_palace_judiciary	A judiciary battles corruption in the district, and follows strict steps to ensure justice is served. The accused is brought in for questioning, before other parties are asked to either corroborate or refute the charges. \\n\\n If evidence or confession leads to indictment, the officials examine the relevant statutes and ordinances carefully to determine how the guilty party should be prosecuted; the legal documents are often very complex, and any misreading can lead to the officers being prosecuted themselves! 	false
building_description_texts_long_description_3k_main_building_long_description_schools_academy_grand	A grand academy boasts magnificent resources for would-be-scholars; both new and old classic texts are available for study to increase knowledge in the fields of culture, religion and strategy. \\n\\n Mastery of these texts is aided by companion commentaries, by elderly scholars, that illuminate important passages based on modern values. Study of past knowledge and how to apply it to modern problems and dilemmas is a vital skill if one wishes to rule, or aid in ruling.	false
building_description_texts_long_description_3k_main_building_long_description_black_mountain_black_mountain_secretariat	Clarity of intent is vital, even – or perhaps especially – when managing an army of bandits. Careful documentation of laws, proposals for public works and other communications need a secretariat. \\n\\n The secretariat keeps immaculate records and registries for the capital, and vastly improves the running of the district, including the raising of a larger garrison, which adds more legitimacy to the faction’s standing, improving public order throughout.	false
building_description_texts_long_description_3k_main_building_long_description_gongsun_zan_military_barracks_commandery	A barracks houses the conscripts responsible for guarding against civil disobedience and enemy attacks. A garrison is responsible for maintaining law and order, as well as security, and disputes and crimes fall under their purview. \\n\\n The administrator for the settlement is thus held accountable for any criminal activity within the town, no matter if the perpetrator is a registered householder, a deserter or a drifter passing through.	false
building_description_texts_long_description_3k_main_building_long_description_craftsmen_armourer_legendary	In all things, there must be a master. This district boasts of a master armourer, one whose creations render all other armour to appear as nothing more than dull plates of metal slung over soldier’s torsos. \\n\\n Warlords personally travel hundreds of miles to this district in the hope of being present when a new masterpiece is forged, so they can boast of possessing one. Patience and fortune are needed to gain such a piece of armour, but the armourer is now employed, so that any new work exclusively belongs to their employer. 	false
building_description_texts_long_description_3k_dlc06_district_government_religion_1	In addition to the essentials needed to survive – food, water, safety – and the pleasures that some say make life worth living, it is vital to nourish the spirit. \\n\\nCertain locations appear naturally suited to the search for inner peace, and in these places, people who seek deeper meaning in life and solace from the darkness of the world will naturally gather, either alone or in companionship with those of a similar outlook.	false
building_description_texts_long_description_3k_main_building_long_description_conscription_barracks_settlers	One of the most insidious threats to a marching army is death from exhaustion and starvation; it is futile to train warriors if they expire before reaching the battlefield, and it cruelly cheats them of an honourable death. \\n\\n The ever-shrewd Cao Cao has instituted the 'tuntian' system, where soldiers fighting far from home also farm the land. With a steady and plentiful food supply, local armies can focus on the military concerns of their campaign, and the district benefits from an increased crop yield too.	false
building_description_texts_long_description_3k_dlc06_district_market_inn_1	Friends meet in a small courtyard, to talk and drink after a hard day's work, sharing jugs of wine brought from home. \\n\\nWhen this simple yet comfortable happenstance becomes a regular habit it is an easy matter to cover over the space and formalise the arrangement to create a place of simple pleasure and open camaraderie that will raise the spirits of all who are invited to enter.	false
building_description_texts_long_description_3k_main_building_long_description_county_tax_collector	The people may curse when they see the approach of a tax collector, but without their services, the district would quickly fall apart and plunge into chaos and disrepair. \\n\\n Taxation is a necessity for the funding of maintenance, repairs and salaries, and must be secured without exception, regardless of the sting. \\n\\n An official whose responsibilities are dedicated to collecting tax quickens this unpleasant business and ensures that the collected monies are applied judiciously towards the improvement of the state.	false
building_description_texts_long_description_3k_ytr_long_description_district_government_organisation_yellow_turban_3	There is a certain tipping point when scattered dissent becomes united resistance. As drops of water form trickles, then streams, then rivers, then floods, a rebellion gathers followers with the same movement and acceleration. \\n\\n As its numbers grow, oppressed people everywhere see its momentum and find courage, becoming new followers. Even those in neighbouring enemy territories who start to question their own prospects find themselves at the threshold of this place to find new comrades.	false
building_description_texts_long_description_3k_main_building_long_description_black_mountain_black_mountain_lair	A lair where Black Mountain bandits can gather means plenty of fresh recruits for the cause. Though it is impossible to remove banditry from the bandit, under a Black Mountain warlord the number of robberies committed is controlled. \\n\\n However, without such strong guidance, bandits will steal at any and every opportunity, and anyone finding such a lair within their territories would be wise to dismantle it.	false
building_description_texts_long_description_3k_ytr_long_description_district_government_rural_healers_yellow_turban_2	Qi is the energy that keeps all people healthy and in balance. If the flow becomes blocked, the energy can pool up and collect in some parts of the body while depriving other areas of any at all. \\n\\n This leads to stagnation and starvation, giving sickness and weakness free reign to spread. An acupuncturist uses needles at key meridians across the body to unlock obstructed Qi, so it can once again move unimpeded. \\n\\n This increases the health of all people, thus growing population and improving replenishment in the area.	false
building_description_texts_long_description_3k_main_building_long_description_trade_port_dock_trading	Though merchants and trade are considered a somewhat shameful occupation by more traditional critics, there is no denying the money they can generate. \\n\\n By allowing merchants to present their wares within the trading district, the town will start gaining a reputation for trade, bringing customers and other merchants – and their accompanying profits – into the district, increasing local trade and trade with neighbouring regions.	false
building_description_texts_long_description_3k_main_building_long_description_han_admin_bureau_province	One of the most complex duties of district administration is the taxation of its people. Without the funds from it, wars could not be fought, infrastructure could not be maintained, and law and order would have none to uphold it. \\n\\n The officials and inspectors in this bureau have a vast experience in the intricacies of land and poll tax and have been selected through recommendation. \\n\\n Each know the correct rate per li for farmland, and how to convert the documents and registers of the district households into taxation.	false
building_description_texts_long_description_3k_main_building_long_description_grain_estates	Estates provide permanent homes for the local farming community, attracting people looking for regular work and increasing the income and food for the province. \\n\\n This creates a miniature ecosystem, where the grain produce from the fields provides food and income to the local peasantry, who use it to pay rent, which goes towards the upkeep of the farms. \\n\\n With this additional revenue, the farming enterprise can be improved by purchasing better tools and hiring in more workers.	false
building_description_texts_long_description_3k_dlc06_city_3	No longer are most citizens equal in status; no longer is everyone's face and name known to everyone else. What were once foot-worn walkways between rows of buildings have become formal streets and alleys. Barter has turned into formal trade, as front rooms become shopfronts, and goods may be stored and warehoused against future need. \\n\\nAs the settlement grows and flourishes, defences become necessary, to guard its citizens and wealth. 	false
building_description_texts_long_description_3k_main_building_long_description_markets_landlords_land_registry	China’s economy is an agricultural one, and so each acre of farmland is a valuable resource that must be accounted for. \\n\\n Registration of land provides documented evidence in the case of future disputes over ownership, and a means of judging taxation. Land tax is based on the size of land and social standing of the owner, based on survey records. \\n\\n Correct taxation of land is vital to the China's economic infrastructure and a well-run office results in more food for the district.	false

Occasionally, they will also find a horse destined to be a steed worthy of kings. \\n\\n In each selection, they have proved to be correct, and the horse has gone on to serve the finest warriors. Such horses are, of course, incredibly rare, and one must rely on fate to deliver one into one’s hands, but with this tamer in employment, the odds of such a thing are greatly increased.	false

building_description_texts_long_description_3k_ytr_long_description_district_military_security_yellow_turban_4	A settlement’s defences must always be ready to repel an enemy attack. Bolstering the guard and raising the alarm when the enemy is already at the gates is of little use, especially as a besiegement rapidly diminishes one’s options for aid and supplies. \\n\\n An entrenched garrison from which to organise supplies ensures that if there is an attack or besiegement, there will be enough resources to hold them off while counter-measures are planned.	false
building_description_texts_long_description_3k_main_building_long_description_iron_military_supply_town	As armies grow in scale, so must the supply of weapons. This province has more than enough raw iron to justify an expansion of its burgeoning iron industry. \\n\\n The village becomes a town, providing more homes for workers, and a call for miners, blacksmiths and administrators is sent out to increase the speed and quality of the process. \\n\\n As the mass production of iron builds to speed, it also creates surplus cuts of scrap iron, which can be sold to provinces who lack iron resources, adding to the town’s income.	false
building_description_texts_long_description_3k_main_building_long_description_salt_works	Alongside iron, salt is one of the main economic forces in China; with increasing demand comes an opportunity for a robust income, but it requires extra investment. \\n\\n The establishing of a salt works near a source of seawater increases the volume of salt collected and attracts people to the area to fill the need for more workers. \\n\\n Several more access points are excavated from the original salt pond, and larger pans are purchased to evaporate and separate the salt from the brine, all greatly increasing the local income.	false
building_description_texts_long_description_3k_main_building_long_description_spice_route_market	The spice industry is growing fast, and what once was a humble trade post blossoms into a marketplace. \\n\\n During their travels along the trade route, the traders running the caravans look for new spices from other provinces, purchasing them to sell on themselves, and expanding the variety of spices for customers to choose from. \\n\\n External spice traders can rent market stalls for a price, and the healthy competition boosts business and attracts even more customers eager to taste the latest sensations.	false

They are carefully guarded and restocked by followers and sympathisers of the Yellow Turbans with loot gathered from enemy settlements. \\n\\n The location of an encampment is made known to any nearby marching armies in case they have need of resupply during their journey. \\n\\n Having a means of supply close by means if an army can quickly return to full strength if they see the opportunity for ambush.	false
building_description_texts_long_description_3k_ytr_long_description_district_government_organisation_yellow_turban_2	Words spoken carelessly can condemn or be condemning, but real change only occurs if thoughts considered dangerous by the authorities can be given voice. \\n\\n If those thoughts catch in the minds of others and find support, then perhaps they are taboo only because they threaten the power of a corrupt ruling class. \\n\\n A remote safehouse provides a place where conversations can be had without fear of reprisal, so that the dangerous thoughts can grow into cries of righteous protest, and perhaps, even new, just laws.	false
building_description_texts_long_description_3k_main_building_long_description_silk_road_trader	Commerce is becoming a powerful force in China, as more luxury items are purchased by generals and warlords as markings of prestige, as well as aesthetic properties. \\n\\n Silk, once only available to emperors, is one of the most sought after and revered luxuries, and a silk road trader can be assured of a profitable venture. \\n\\n Silk must be collected from insect larvae, woven into fabric, pounded to a softness and then bundled into rolls for easy handling. The effort produces stunning results, and warrants the high prices.	false
building_description_texts_long_description_3k_main_building_long_description_zheng_jian_tributary_court_complex	A tributary court complex houses the officials assigned to administer payments and gifts from vassals. The key to rule is expansion; power must extend and grow at the correct rate to support itself without overreaching and collapsing in on itself. \\n\\n A tributary court complex is a natural and practical outgrowth of this, and a somewhat self-fulfilling prophecy; its size implies authority, and therefore payments towards the great cause are increased, even if it causes some consternation amongst the vassal states.	false
building_description_texts_long_description_3k_main_building_long_description_jade_artisan	Because of its beauty, rarity and the time and skill needed to work with it, Jade is the most desirable of all precious stones. For the few that can afford it, commissions are placed with artisans within the province to create unique and transcendent pieces. \\n\\n These artisans possess the technical skill of craftsmen, but bring their own individual visions of how to best represent goodness and purity to the work, thus making each piece with the same love and respect the jade itself possesses.	false
building_description_texts_long_description_3k_main_building_long_description_tools_depot	The purpose of tools is to do the things a person cannot do, and to ease the strain of repetitive and heavy physical labour. However, even tools become worn or broken by overuse, especially those that are the most useful and vital to production. \\n\\n A tool depot is a preventative and restorative resource, where broken tools are repaired, replaced or receive regular maintenance to extend their lives. The farmer that constantly checks and keeps their tools in good condition will save themselves a great cost later!	false
building_description_texts_long_description_3k_main_building_long_description_turban_temple_eternal_reason_grand	A city that houses a grand temple will attract many visitors and worshippers. Its magnificent appearance is a manifestation of the goodness and healing that can be found inside for the penitent and faithful. \\n\\n Chanting can be heard from outside the temple, as all within raise their voices as one. Within the grand temple are houses of peace and quiet, where the sick reside and reflect on their sins. \\n\\n Once sin is recognised, confession will purge the spirit and rid them of the corruption that plagues them.	false
building_description_texts_long_description_3k_dlc06_district_residential_logistics_5	To store enough rice and other non-perishable foodstuffs to cover any shortage and respond to any emergency, an impressive building must be erected. \\n\\nThis great edifice needs to be fully proof against the elements, be it mountain storms or the risk of flooding. The precious stores within must be kept safe from rats and other vermin. Last but not least it must be made secure from people, either local thieves or external marauders. 	false

Each one has proven their experience in other administrations and recruited through recommendations by respected colleagues. \\n\\n The administration of a faction must be run with peak efficiency to be taken seriously. A directorate to oversee administrative matters moves the Black Mountain bandits further from their lawless roots and closer to legitimacy, improving public order and reducing the potential for corruption.	false

By observing the horses as they are trained for battle, this tamer can discern when there is one fit to carry the greatest warriors. \\n\\n Though rare, the occasions of finding potential in such horses is rising; any steeds of such quality will be reserved, so that in time unique mounts can be assured for the most elite warriors.	false
building_description_texts_long_description_3k_main_building_long_description_lumber_bamboo_woodcutter_storage	Transportation of timber from the forest to the lumber yard is, at the least, difficult, and the worst, dangerous. \\n\\n Timber is heavy, cumbersome, and if dropped, could injure or crush the workers moving it. A safer way of transporting the timber is to dig a channel from the source to the lumber yard and then laying the timber in the channel and use water to propel it towards its destination. \\n\\n Apart from being safer, it is also a more efficient use of the worker’s time, freeing them to continue felling the trees.	false
building_description_texts_long_description_3k_dlc06_district_artisan_labour_5	Thanks to the skills of your trained architects, buildings are designed with great care, ensuring harmony is maintained in their symmetry and the careful articulation of their various elements.

This province is rich with jade, making it only natural for a trading base of operations for those who have the business acumen to do so. \\n\\n This trading village sells the jade works created by both artisans and craftsmen, depending on who arrives to purchase their goods. Craftsmen and artisans may be able to create beautiful things, but they need traders to sell their wares.	false
building_description_texts_long_description_3k_dlc06_district_military_conscription_2	Raw recruits are clay, soft and unformed. They must be moulded into a fighting force, and that process starts here, on the training ground. \\n\\n Conscripts can expect to practice the same basic moves – to block, to attack, to advance – until they happen without conscious thought. In addition, they learn to pay attention to what their comrades are doing and to obey orders without question. Training together is vital both to increase individual fighting skills and encourage warriors to bond. 	false
building_description_texts_long_description_3k_main_building_long_description_district_market_merchant_registry_office	China’s trade is ever-expanding, and the merchants who sell goods created from the works of others grow wealthier. Their profits should benefit all efforts towards the great cause, and this can be done through taxation. \\n\\n Merchants are therefore ordered to register at an office, so correct taxes can be levied, and to ensure they adhere to statutes forbidding them from attempts to enter public office, should they be tempted to abuse the power. \\n\\n These additional taxes increase income without fully deterring the vital trade that is quickly becoming China's lifeblood.	false
building_description_texts_long_description_3k_main_building_long_description_decadence_zhong_palace_of_zhong_dynasty	A warlord who rules over a new dynasty naturally needs a palace befitting their status. Under their guidance, officials busy themselves with the running of the capital – collecting taxes and raising garrisons – each in turn being monitored by their superior, reducing the chance of abuses of power. \\n\\n This architectural wonder is a symbol to the people of the permanence of the Zhong dynasty, and the promise of stability from chaos calms and appeases them, ushering in a new era.	false
building_description_texts_long_description_3k_main_building_long_description_iron_military_supply_village	To take full advantage of the rich supply of iron nearby, this village is rebuilt to supply allied forces with weapons. The mined ore is taken by labourers to blast furnaces which produce several tons of iron a day. \\n\\n It is then wrought by heating until molten and stirred until it loses its carbon. After weapons are forged from the wrought iron, it awaits collection by the military. \\n\\n Such a small, contained economy helps the village thrive, and as they become experts, the mass-produced weapons improve in quality.	false
building_description_texts_long_description_3k_main_building_long_description_copper_pits	Where the land is rich with copper, and not buried deep underground, it can be mined more easily with the creation of a copper pit. \\n\\n Once a surface copper source is confirmed, conscript labourers excavate a perimeter around it, and dig a series of steps into the ground to provide easy access for miners. \\n\\n As the pit is mined, it continues to be enlarged outwards until all the copper has been found and extracted or what remains is no longer profitable enough to warrant further manpower and funds.	false
building_description_texts_long_description_3k_main_building_long_description_district_market_drum_and_bell_tower	Work and rest must be balanced and in harmony; too much of one impairs the other and leads to a deterioration of the fundamentals. A tall tower in the market square marks the time with music, with the sounding of a bell as dawn breaks and the beating of drums as dusk arrives. \\n\\n It is a unifying call for the people to remind them to be vigilant and hard-working during the daylight hours and allow themselves time for rest and contemplation before nightfall.	false
building_description_texts_long_description_3k_main_building_long_description_gov_support_drifter_farming_camp	Fortune has not been kind to China; whether suffering the ravages of a divided empire through war, or famine, drought and floods, the people of this land are increasingly disenfranchised, with many losing their livelihoods and homes. \\n\\n This massive uprooting of the populace, fleeing disaster and searching for new homes, displaces many, causing them to become drifters. To combat this, government-sponsored farming camps are set up to put the people back to work, attracting people to the land in return with the promise of work and new homes.	false
building_description_texts_long_description_3k_main_building_long_description_spice_route_trading_post	A trading post can be established from the profits of a successful spice business. Extensions are built to contain more barrels, pots and bags, and filled to the brim with spices. \\n\\n Experience has taught the trader more about spices, and they have become experts in how to extract the best from seeds and roots, and how each one must be stored to preserve their quality. \\n\\n The rich, warm colours of the spices are a selling point in themselves, enticing customers to the post to taste samples before purchasing.	false
building_description_texts_long_description_3k_main_building_long_description_logistics_granary	A granary holds a large supply of grain for both food and trade. Grain stocks are constantly replenished so that, if merchants should attempt to artificially raise grain prices, the stores can be sold off at low prices to counteract the inflation. \\n\\n In times of famine or other natural disasters, the granary is tapped to fend off starvation. It also ensures that the city has food for emergencies, particularly if under siege.	false
building_description_texts_long_description_3k_ytr_long_description_district_government_yellow_turban_gardens_2	The flow of Qi is vital to a healthy body and spirit. If the Qi is polluted or blocked, then it can be harmful and damaging to one’s body. One of the ways to transform polluted Qi to healthy Qi is to use meditation. \\n\\n Meditation trains the mind in concentration, imagination and visualisation. Concentration teaches how to enter a state of nothingness, so that the mind has the space to experience the world free of thinking about it. \\n\\n Imagination and visualisation help to conceptualise Qi travelling through the body like a healing mist.	false
building_description_texts_long_description_3k_main_building_long_description_admin_palace_court	Laws keep the workers under control and promote order. \\n\\n Practical solutions to problems are arrived at by the imperial office and passed down in the form of unquestionable statutes and ordinances; ignorance of them is no excuse, no matter how contradictory or confusing they may appear. \\n\\n A court is a forum for prosecution when these laws are broken, and grievances can be brought by anyone. It is every citizen’s duty to uphold the law, and failing to bring a crime to the court’s attention is itself a criminal act. 	false
building_description_texts_long_description_3k_main_building_long_description_horses_tribal_host	Expert breeding, grazing, rearing and training create the sturdiest steeds. Reuniting China will require no mean feat, and such an ambitious campaign will need great heroes to call upon who can in turn, inspire others to greatness. \\n\\n Such heroes will need heroic horses to ride into battle and to be ally to their deeds. A hero’s horse will not shrink from charging towards danger, or falter and panic during the cacophony of war, and will not leave its master to the mercies of foes, but remain by their side until the end. 	false
building_description_texts_long_description_3k_resource_banditry_charity_1	To live a bandit's life is to not know from where your next meal may come, and at what cost. To raid is to survive, yet the government is the target, not the vast peasant population of China. They want nothing more than to live peaceful lives, provide for their families, and survive. \\n\\n To this end, those peasants whose homes fall under bandit jurisdiction are not forgotten, and the spoils of battle, when possible, are readily shared amongst the populace.	false

Those who can do so build around courtyards, or at least light-wells, to maintain the sense of space.  \\n\\nShops, tea houses and places of worship are springing up to serve the growing populace. 	false
building_description_texts_long_description_3k_main_building_long_description_security_mounted_patrols	Bandits and enemies will seize any opportunity to cause trouble and must be guarded against at all times. Mounted patrols will counteract this by making regular sweeps of the local area and engaging or reporting any enemy activity. \\n\\n The Ma family are renowned for their use of cavalry, and the mobility of mounted patrols enables horses to cover a lot of ground quickly, so that they can chase down and harass trespassers and react quickly to news of others encroaching on their territory.	false

The barracks are a clear sign of authority in the town, and encourages citizens to obey its laws.	false

building_description_texts_long_description_3k_main_building_long_description_conscription_headquarters_agricultural_garrisons	A greater number of workers in the fields requires an equally ambitious expansion in their management; without careful handling, a larger workforce risks increasing the chances of food wastage, and causes more problems than it solves. \\n\\n A headquarters supervises the conscript farmers, plans and tracks the sowing of new crops, and monitors the produce, mitigating the chance of food being left to rot or be stolen. Thus, more food reaches the local military forces, increasing replenishment in the district.	false

Copper veins can be found by searching lakes and rivers for copper residue and then using the flow of water to trace the residue back to a source. \\n\\n Once discovered, an expedition is arranged to tap the veins for copper so it can be forged into useful objects. This district has proven to be rich in the useful metal, and deserving of investment, increasing trade and income for the district.	false

When armies are in remote areas, or far from their own supply lines, the danger of starvation or sickness can do as much damage as a surprise ambush or rain of arrows. \\n\\n The tuntian system organises soldiers to build and work farms, so that food can be grown to feed and supply allies in the local area. This increases both the goods in the area and the replenishment of fresh troops for nearby armies.	false

The clamour of merchants vying for customers' attention, the setting up of stalls and moving of goods all contribute to the healthy bedlam of a thriving market. \\n\\n However, to keep it from tipping into chaos, a market officer is required to license deals, collect commercial taxes, and solve disputes before they escalate. \\n\\n A marketplace also sees large volumes of strangers moving through it, and a market official helps to keep an eye out for any characters acting suspiciously and possibly in the employ of the enemy.	false

To properly sate their appetites, groups of farmers across the land are conscripted to establish an agricultural garrison colony. \\n\\n With them, they bring farming experience, which increases food and replenishment rate of local armies as well as adding more manpower to the colony’s garrison.	false

building_description_texts_long_description_3k_main_building_long_description_bandits_makeshift_shelter	The weakening and dissolution of central government is more than a political upset – it is the failure of rulers in their responsibilities to the ruled. As chaos seizes the land, more people are forced to steal to survive. \\n\\n Often these people are drifters, displaced from their homes and livelihoods by war or disaster. A makeshift shelter provides some protection against the elements, but also acts as a gathering place from which new bandits are recruited and loot is organised and divided.	false

Timber is heavy, cumbersome, and if dropped, could injure or crush the workers moving it. \\n\\n A safer way of transporting the timber is to dig a channel from the source to the lumber yard and then laying the timber in the channel and use water to propel it towards its destination. \\n\\n Apart from being safer, it is also a more efficient use of the worker’s time, freeing them to continue felling the trees.	false
building_description_texts_long_description_3k_ytr_long_description_district_military_security_yellow_turban_3	A garrison does more than maintain order within a settlement and ward off attackers. It also organises supplies for its marching armies, so that they may always be battle-ready. \\n\\n A permanent base from which equipment and supplies can be sent is vital to gradual expansion, or even act as a place of safety to retreat to and restock in the case of an unexpected defeat. \\n\\n The larger capacity and increased number of workers also allow for more supplies to be stockpiled and delivered.	false

building_description_texts_long_description_3k_main_building_long_description_lumber_pine_timber_storage	A storehouse keeps collected timber safe from extreme weather, preventing it from being ruined before it can be used. \\n\\n To limit infestation by pests and insects, or fungal infections, the timber is felled in winter. The cold weather allows it to dry out slowly, avoiding the splitting and cracking that can occur by drying too rapidly in the hot summer months. \\n\\n Once stored, the timber is easier to track, by having the volumes recorded and marked out for different cuttings, depending on its final use.	false
building_description_texts_long_description_3k_main_building_long_description_schools_provincial	If one has ambitions to be emperor, one must learn more than military expertise alone – a knowledge and understanding of China’s culture and values is just as much part of knowing how to protect China from its enemies. \\n\\n The building of a school, where these things can be studied and taught, increases experience in worldly matters, so that eventually, those that attend may go out and affect the world for the better.	false

A water garden is full of gentle streams and ponds and reconnects one with nature’s gifts and lessons. \\n\\n If quieting one’s mind to find nothingness is difficult, then focus on an aspect of nature, such as a gently flowing stream, helps silent observation and a relaxation of thoughts.	false

building_description_texts_long_description_3k_dlc06_district_government_administration_3	With regular meetings attended by professional administrators, governance becomes simpler. \\n\\nAs administration comes at a cost, the levels of taxation will be set, and the collection of taxes organised.

building_description_texts_long_description_3k_main_building_long_description_admin_palace_jade_seal_archive	The jade seal is the imperial seal signalling the emperor’s Mandate of Heaven, and proof of their infallibility. The emperor’s guides to preserve lawfulness are handed down in statutes and ordinances to be closely followed or risk prosecution. \\n\\n Officials of the highest authority interpret how those who disobey these laws are tried and punished, with the rules sometimes spread over many different documents. As such, a holistic knowledge and eye for minutiae is needed to translate the emperor’s laws correctly. 	false

When slowly sipping tea, it is impossible to shout, and gives the drinker time to contemplate and absorb new ideas from their companion, no matter how controversial. \\n\\n The tranquillity of the tea house encourages civility and respect among its patrons, enhancing their better qualities.	false
building_description_texts_long_description_3k_main_building_long_description_village_scholar	Those from privileged lineages are often bestowed the title of scholar through mere nepotism, squandering the wisdom within their grasp while doing little to justify the esteem gained from it. A Yellow Turban scholar seeks not recognition and glory, but enlightenment. \\n\\n Long hours studying the Tao Te Ching provides the tools with which to solve problems, or at least shine light on paths towards resolution, which the scholar uses to advise the community on practical matters, greatly increasing the pace of research.	false

If a solider is to survive battle, he must know and trust his comrades utterly; they become his new family. \\n\\nSoldiers are a hungry lot, and the energy required for their constant drilling and training is provided by frequent, hearty meals that many peasants would envy.

The coins are flat, circular and have a hole in the centre so they can be strung together with string for carrying. \\n\\n The standardisation of coins renders the old tender, such as miniatures of spades or knives, little more than curiosities. And of course, a circular shape is less likely to tear through the pockets of its owners and spill onto the ground.	false

The contents are carefully regulated and distributed to ensure people are fed enough in order to work, leaving enough surplus to be sold on to those districts where grain is scarce. \\n\\n Management and balancing of grain supply is vital to ensure that when one district is low on grain, it can be resupplied by another and vice versa. In this way, effective nationwide distribution can occur, ensuring a steady food supply for all citizens.	false

building_description_texts_long_description_3k_main_building_long_description_copper_mining_village	To take full advantage of the rich supply of copper nearby, this village has been developed to fully focus on mining. With most villagers employed as miners, blacksmiths, labourers, artisans or merchants in the mining operation, the yields are greater and the shared expertise grows quickly. \\n\\n This small but self-sustaining economy helps the village thrive as a community, as well as increasing the quality of the copper goods, and therefore raising the revenue generated from them.	false

building_description_texts_long_description_3k_main_building_long_description_markets_landlords_land_surveying	An initial examination and mapping of the land provides valuable information on which acres will be the most suitable for farming. \\n\\n Tested and proved mathematical guidelines enable the complex measuring of the height, width, and volume of land, so that it can be mapped precisely for reference. \\n\\n Nearby rivers and canals are noted for their proximity to areas with good soil for potential diversion for irrigation purposes. Once this research is complete, land can be allocated for farming with confidence.	false

They can be trusted to put every available patch of fertile soil to good use. \\n\\nThe narrowest strip of land may be planted with a row of cabbages which please the eye and help fill the pot, while larger plots will be carefully arranged with mixed crops.	false
building_description_texts_long_description_3k_main_building_long_description_lumber_pine_yard	A local lumber yard reduces the maintenance cost of buildings, as it means the heaviest, and most cumbersome materials builders need for construction are closer, and therefore, cheaper to obtain. \\n\\n The opening of the yard attracts more people to the area looking for regular work, of which there is plenty; the trees are selected, then felled, before the timber is transported back and processed as lumber for selling. \\n\\n Finally, seeds must be planted to replace the felled trees to keep the forest plentiful for future use.	false

building_description_texts_long_description_3k_main_building_long_description_harbour_jetties	A jetty extends the reach of the village’s existing pier, reaching out past the shallows of the coast over deeper waters, to enable fishing without the need for a boat. \\n\\n It also has a greater space for incoming or outgoing boats used for trading and transport, and increases commerce in a town. \\n\\n The jetty can then be developed into a commercial or fishing harbour, depending on which one yields the greater profit.	false
building_description_texts_long_description_3k_main_building_long_description_horses_tribal_camps	Cavalry is the force that can break a thousand infantrymen, but like a sword, it must be tempered and tested before wielded. When startled by a sudden loud noise, intense heat or violence, a horse’s natural reflex is to panic, turn and quickly gallop away. \\n\\n This instinct must be trained out of the horses destined for active duty, and the riders must learn how to control them in the chaos of battle. A steed deserves as much respect as its rider, if it is to be expected to perform with the same loyalty and bravery.	false

Accidents involving the felling of trees, dropping timber during transportation and incidents simply from sheer exhaustion can take a toll on the workers. \\n\\n A camp, situated near the pine or bamboo forest, gives weary workers a place to retire and rest after their toil. With a clearer head, tragedies are less likely to occur, making the work more attractive to migrants looking for work.	false
building_description_texts_long_description_3k_main_building_long_description_fishing_grand_shipyard	The nearby forest furnishes this province with a rich source of lumber, providing the materials for construction of ships. \\n\\n To accommodate building such large vessels, a grand shipyard must be constructed first. Shipbuilding requires skilled craftsmen, bringing many new job opportunities and income into the province. \\n\\n As more ships are built, a greater number of fishing expeditions can be embarked upon, leading to a faster turnover of the volume of fish brought in, and adding to the province’s economy.	false

Dongwu mercenaries inhabit this district, and are especially accomplished in the ways of sea and river warfare. \\n\\n A conscription office will aid in the hiring of these mercenaries, greatly speeding up the rate at which forces can be filled with fresh bodies. 	false

building_description_texts_long_description_3k_main_building_long_description_jade_collectors	Jade is a beautiful stone possessed of many fine, even magical qualities; kindness, rectitude, wisdom, bravery and purity. Heaven sends it to us by way of nature; the spring floods wash the stones down from the mountains where they rest and settle upon the shores of the river beds. \\n\\n After one of these floods, pickers search the river beds for jade, looking for its distinct colour shining through the shallow waters. Once gathered, the jade can be sold to artisans or wealthy collectors for a good profit.	false

building_description_texts_long_description_3k_main_building_long_description_city_level_city	A city moulds the people that live within its walls as surely as they shape its development. \\n\\n Newly-commissioned buildings have swelled the city’s perimeter in concert with its population, and the people have grown a little shrewder as the naiveté born of small villages is dwarfed by large stone walls and replaced by the opportunities of city life. \\n\\n After all, the city is the heart of the commandery, and its busy, beating rhythms set the pace of development in the surrounding districts.	false
building_description_texts_long_description_3k_main_building_long_description_private_workshops_craftsmen	Craftsmen lack the individual artistic streak of artisans, but their purpose is towards the mass production of goods. \\n\\n Indeed, the work of artisans is more suited to the wealthier patrons who request goods tailored to their liking, whereas craftsmen produce goods for all, based on current trends; although their goods are likely to be inspired by artisan wares, they are transformed into commercial commodities for the mass market. \\n\\n Craftsmen workshops provide the space and tools needed to create these goods. 	false
building_description_texts_long_description_3k_dlc06_district_market_trade_4	With the proper administration and a space dedicated to it, trade can operate more efficiently. Surpluses can be held over for later sale, regulations enforced to ensure high quality, and prices monitored to avoid fraud. \\n\\nMerchants have always had to bear a heavy burden when it comes to tax, but when the profits rise in concert with the expansion of trade, they are no longer at a disadvantage. It is true that crime and corruption may grow as trading does, but it is a small price to pay.  	false

This town has been developed from a modest village and now boasts a large stone wall around the perimeter, clearly outlining its borders. \\n\\n The promise of work and homes for those who have lost much to the ravages of natural disasters and warring factions has drawn many to its gates, extending the community as the town continues to develop.	false
building_description_texts_long_description_3k_main_building_long_description_han_admin_office_county	The funds collected by taxation are the lifeblood of any administration. This office includes a staff of inspectors who oversee the work of each official department and report on any instances of merit or incompetence. \\n\\n This oversight improves the efficiency of tax collection within the office, and ensures that collected funds are well spent; roads and bridges require constant maintenance, but there needs to be provisions for disasters in the form of flood defences, or a grain store in the case of a failed harvest.	false

After being found guilty, an appeal can be lodged by the accused, or if facing the death penalty, the accused’s relatives. This appeal is referred up to higher authorities for consideration and judgement. \\n\\n To prevent abuse of the system, if the accused is still found guilty after appealing, their punishment is increased; should the appeal have been lodged by relatives, they too could suffer punishment by the shame of tattooing or hard labour.	false
building_description_texts_long_description_3k_dlc06_city_2	The simple bamboo or packed-earth huts which were once enough for the tribe are being replaced; solid wooden frames are spanned by smooth wattle-and-daub walls and roofed with thatch. A few larger buildings can now be seen here, as the community expands beyond the initial huddled hamlet. \\n\\nNeighbours are still expected to share with one another, but it has become acceptable to ask for something in return, and barter between individuals and families is becoming common practice.	false
building_description_texts_long_description_3k_main_building_long_description_gongsun_zan_military_command_headquarters	A headquarters of military command provides a garrison to enforce law and order, and promotes the discipline of military doctrine amongst its population, increasing the experience of locally-recruited soldiers. \\n\\n The officials here have been promoted for their exemplary service, ensuring that the headquarters runs with the precision of a seasoned army. Though a boon to Gongsun Zan’s campaign, such ambition must be guarded against, so responsibilities, and thus power, are divided among officials to prevent coups. 	false
building_description_texts_long_description_3k_main_building_long_description_gov_support_farm_supply_storage	Once workers have been gathered and allocated homes, they must have tools in order to work. The supply storage town provides the workers with the seeds of the crops planned for production for the next harvest. \\n\\n These crops are specially planned each season for the greatest possible yield; the staple crops being wheat and barley in the winter and millet in the summer, along with beans and rice. This ensures that the crop is always grown in concert with the weather and other seasonal characteristics.	false

A food merchant can choose to specialise in one kind of food, or have a mixture for customers to choose from. \\n\\n Some food may even be sold on to third parties, who can then sell on in their own markets and, should the goods be scarce or impossible to grow, breed or farm in their own region.	false
building_description_texts_long_description_3k_main_building_long_description_iron_craftwork_village	A very different skill is needed to shape iron ore into craftworks; though the hands that work and shape the raw materials must be no less precise, an artistic and imaginative eye is needed to imbue the objects with value. \\n\\n Trained artisans have this eye, and their practiced hands can create popular, but artful pieces for mass production and sale. An artists’ touch has a transformative effect on simple cooking implements and add enhance the inherent beauty of decorative gates and statues of spiritual importance.	false
building_description_texts_long_description_3k_dlc06_district_market_trade_5	Though China will always need farmers and administrators, the way of the trader is the future. \\n\\nMerchants band together, allowing them to buy in bulk and hence at lower prices. Contacts and connections are made, stretching far beyond the province, along caravan routes and out into foreign lands. Through these new conduits of commerce luxury goods, exotic novelties and new ideas flow into the region.	false

Working in such a co-ordinated and harmonious manner they will raise buildings to long outlast their builders.	false
building_description_texts_long_description_3k_main_building_long_description_jade_trading_town	As jade profits grow, it is time to start reinvesting them into the expansion of this province’s trade. By expanding the village into a trading town, more workers can be employed to achieve a faster and more efficient moving of the goods. \\n\\n The mythical reputation of jade imbues the town with a magical feel; wealthy collectors will travel great distances to purchase its wares, and owning jade items bought from it is a sign of envious prestige, ensuring others will turn as green as the stone itself.	false

Household records are inspected and updated to remain accurate, and to aid the annual conscription of civilians. \\n\\n Conscripts are then assigned to the garrison to guard against any lawlessness from within and enemy attacks from without.	false
building_description_texts_long_description_3k_main_building_long_description_jade_craftsmen	Once jade has been gathered, craftsmen are hired to start sculpting it into decorative forms. First a design is created or commissioned. \\n\\n Then the stones are given a basic starting shape by burnishing it with cord and sand, before slow and precise drill carving of the hard stone reveals the final form waiting within. \\n\\n The process is long, and requires the work of very skilled craftsmen, and as such, magnifies the worth and price of the final product, be it decoration for gates, armour, statues or jewellery.	false

However, they are not particularly intelligent, and even the most domesticated will wander if not properly secured. \\n\\n It is easy to lose beasts to the elements, predators or even rival farmers, thus losing the time and cost invested in rearing them. \\n\\n A small corral will keep them relatively safe – at least from themselves – until they are ready to be shepherded out to pastures for grazing.	false

These encourage the cultivation of a social conscience so that all relations – social, political and cultural – are viewed through the same lens. \\n\\n In doing this, equal importance is applied to the inner and outer life of each person, and all gain an understanding that goodness comes from reconciling outer and inner concerns, state and family, and that no subject should be considered without those principles in mind.	false

To do any less would bring shame on their venerable lord.	false
